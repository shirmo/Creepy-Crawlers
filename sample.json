        "Text": "Today, AI is all about algorithms running on remote servers. But it can be so much more. AI could be embedded in our everyday objects and truly change our daily life.\nThat\u2019s where the UDOO KEY comes in.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UDOO KEY is a fully programmable Raspberry Pi RP2040 + ESP32 microcontroller with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy. It\u2019s more than just a piece of hardware: it also gives you access to our AI platform, Clea, with pre-trained AI models to deploy your AI app in minutes.\n\nAnd all this at a once-in-a-lifetime starting price of $4.\u00a0\n\nIn short, it gives you access to a new era of micro-computing. Not so long ago, microcontrollers were single-purpose devices. Not anymore with UDOO KEY! Physical programming and do-it-yourself electronics. Fleet management. IoT analytics, over-the-air updates. Telemetry. AI.\u00a0\n\nJust imagine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UDOO KEY allows you to use either RP2040, ESP32, or both, building your AI projects on your own terms. And most importantly, both MCUs are of the highest quality.\n\nThe best part about it? Breadth of choice.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pico-compatible part is built upon a Raspberry Pi RP2040 dual ARM Cortex-M0, with a QSPI 8MB Flash, a 133MHz clock and 264KB of on-chip SRAM.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UDOO KEY\u2019s ESP32, an ESP32-WROVER-E, is based on a dual-core Xtensa 32-bit LX6, with a 16MB flash memory, an 8MB PSRAM, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and BLE.\n\nMind you: the ESP32 on board is not just a Wi-Fi, BT & BLE module. On the contrary, it gives you full access to the firmware of ESP32 and you can program it as you please.\u00a0\n\nThe two microcontrollers can talk to each other via serial port.\u00a0\n\nAnd that's not all. The two modules can also communicate via SWD interface.\n\nYou can program the board via USB-C and decide whether to talk with Raspberry Pi or ESP32 via jumper. Since the ESP32 does not naturally mount a USB port, we implemented a UART-to-USB bridge.\u00a0\n\nBoth microcontrollers can be programmed using different environments, such as TinyML, TensorFlow Lite, MicroPython, C/C++, and many more, giving you plenty of options to streamline your AI application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Best in class developer experience\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the ground up, the UDOO KEY is designed by developers for developers, and it comes built-in with all the tools to make development as smooth as possible. The microcontroller comes with a dedicated, fully open-source firmware based on Free RTOS and with ready to use SDKs to make it as simple as possible to build your next big thing.\n\nUDOO KEY is designed to natively support Clea.\n\nClea is an extensible AI & IoT platform.\n\nIt allows to gather and manage data from connected devices and create flows tailored to the user's needs. It also provides visualization tools to turn IoT data into actionable insights.\n\nThe platform is based on apps and an SDK that allow developer to quickly embed models pre-built by SECO Mind. Each model is optimized for UDOO KEY and Edge devices, either Arm or x86, with a tuned interface engine depending on the hardware.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClea is built on top of two open-source projects we maintain: Astarte and Edgehog.\u00a0\n\nAstarte allows the developers to manage and process IoT data: from collection to processing up to data orchestration. It features a full-fledged SDK\u00a0for ESP32 based on the Espressif IoT Development Framework (ESP-IDF), so you can be productive with UDOO KEY and\u00a0Clea in a matter of minutes and with just a few lines of code.\n\nEdgehog enables fleet device management and OTA updates, enhancing ESP32's firmware with a full-fledged device lifecycle solution. We're in the process of making Edgehog available entirely Open Source, so watch this page for updates!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe believe that the key to unlock the power of Edge AI is the app model. The smartphone is so easy to use because of the multitouch user interface. But what made it so powerful was the possibility to download an app for every task. The very same model can be replicated with AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s say you need a face recognition application. That very same app has probably been written countless times before by thousands of developers worldwide.\n\nImagine now being able to deploy a pre-built hardware-optimized version of this app on your devices - your UDOO KEYs, for instance.\n\nThat\u2019s what we are building.\u00a0\n\nNo need to reinvent the wheel every time. Finally, AI becomes a platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPredictive maintenance is the capability to measure the lifetime of an object and detect a malfunction before it happens. It does so by analyzing data from connected devices through machine learning algorithms.\n\nIn the video, a predictive maintenance AI model is used to predict a possible malfunction of the fork due to excessive strength.\n\nThis project employs two UDOO KEY components:\n\n\nThe 9-axis IMU (Magnetometer, Accelerometer, Gyroscope) of UDOO KEY\u2019s ESP32.\nA Clea predictive maintenance AI model.\n\n\nMind you: the smart bike is just an example of predictive maintenance with UDOO KEY.\nA predictive maintenance AI model can be used in countless industrial and non-industrial scenarios for LCA and to reduce downtime.\n\n\n\n\n\nSound recognition is the capability to identify a specific sound. In the video, sound recognition is used to identify a bird from the noise it makes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project employs the following UDOO KEY components:\n\n\nThe digital microphone of UDOO KEY\u2019s ESP32.\u00a0\nWireless communication (Wi-Fi/BT/BLE) enabled by ESP32.\nA Clea sound recognition AI model.\n\u00a0\n\nRemember: this is just an example of a sound recognition application. You can use UDOO KEY to test your sound recognition AI model in several industrial and non industrial scenarios or use our own.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave you ever desired to get a coffee just with the power of your voice? Now, you can.\n\nThis voice-activated coffee machine is the evolution of an old project of ours, UDOO Coffee Machine, and also takes inspiration from several Arduino Coffee Machines you can find online.\n\nThe concept is simple: you activate the coffee machine by spelling a command word - in this example, \u201cHey UDOO.\u201d After that, the coffee machine asks a scripted question to confirm that you really want a coffee. If you confirm, coffee is coming!\n\nThis project employs the following UDOO KEY components:\n\n\nThe digital microphone of UDOO KEY\u2019s ESP32.\nThe I/Os of Raspberry Pi RP2040 to easily hack your coffee machine.\nThe Grove Kit, developed in collaboration with Seeed Studio.\nA Clea keyword recognition AI model.\n\u00a0\n\nPlease note that this voice-activated coffee machine is just an example of keyword recognition with UDOO KEY.\n\nClea and UDOO KEY gives you everything you need to test your own keyword recognition AI model or use our own, which you can apply to hundreds of industrial and everyday scenarios.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is an example of object detection & classification made with UDOO KEY.\n\nIn this scenario, UDOO KEY gives your trash bins superpowers. Thanks to UDOO KEY, your trash bin can:\n\n\nVerify whether the trash bin is full or not.\nIdentify the material of the piece of garbage you hold in your hand.\nOpen the proper container.\n\u00a0\n\nBasically, this is a combination of several open-source projects. Specifically:\n\n\n\u00a0Arduino Trash Classification based on TinyML\u00a0\n\u00a0Arduino Smart Trash Bin to check whether the trash bin is full or not.\n\u00a0\n\nThis project employs the following UDOO KEY components:\n\n\nThe Cam KIT, developed in collaboration with Arducam.\nThe I/Os of Raspberry Pi RP2040 to easily hack your trash bin.\nPimoroni, i.e. a display compatible with Raspberry Pi Pico.\nA Clea object detection & classification AI model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGesture recognition is the capability to detect a specific gesture.\n\nIn the video, a UDOO KEY is inserted inside a toy to turn it into a magic wand, giving it new abilities, such as:\n\n\nChange light patterns of bluetooth-enabled LED strips.\nActivate bluetooth speakers.\n\u00a0\n\nAll of these abilities are gesture-activated thanks to UDOO KEY\u2019s 9-axis IMU.\nThis project employs the following UDOO KEY components:\n\n\nThe 9-axis IMU (Magnetometer, Accelerometer, Gyroscope) of UDOO KEY\u2019s ESP32.\nThe I/Os of Raspberry Pi RP2040 to easily hack your magic wand.\nWireless communication (Wi-Fi/BT/BLE), enabled by the ESP32.\u00a0\nA Clea gesture recognition AI model.\n\n\nNote: this is just an example of gesture recognition with UDOO KEY. Thanks to UDOO KEY, you can easily run your gesture recognition AI model or use our own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFace recognition is the capability to detect and identify a face in a stream. Although UDOO KEY does not feature a camera, it mounts a camera connector and is compatible with Arducam.\n\nThere are several face recognition projects you can make with UDOO KEY, both in industrial and non-industrial scenarios, using our own AI model or one made by you.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe built the UDOO KEY to empower you.\n\nIf you are a developer that wants full control with no bells and whistles, then the UDOO KEY Basic is for you: it mounts no sensors, so as to let you expand it with your favorite modules. Otherwise, pick the UDOO KEY PRO.\n\nThe UDOO KEY PRO mounts two powerful sensors: a 9-axis IMU and a digital microphone. It is ready to let you start with your AI project right away.\n\nThe 9-axis IMU sensor combines an accelerometer, a magnetometer and a gyroscope in a single module to streamline a wide array of projects, from robotics and RC cars up to smart bikes and automation. It is connected to the ESP32 via I2C bus. You can decide whether to access the I2C bus via ESP32 or RP2040 through the jumper switch.\n\nThe digital microphone, on the other hand, is designed for AI-powered sound & voice recognition as well as audio control a-la Alexa. It is connected to the ESP32 via I2S bus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UDOO KEY gives you plenty of options when it comes to interfaces.\n\nFirst thing first, it features three LEDs - one blue, one yellow and one green. The blue one signals a successful connection to Clea, the second one is for Wi-Fi/BT activities, and it's managed by ESP32's IO33 (pin #9). The green one is connected to RP2040's GPIO25. All LEDs are fully programmable.\n\nIn terms of interfaces, you can use UDOO KEY the very same way you'd use Raspberry Pi Pico and ESP32.\n\nLast but not least, the UEXT connector is accessible from the ESP32, which exposes the I2C, UART and SPI interfaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe built the UDOO KEY to empower you. If you are an embedded developer that wants full control and a minimal set of sensors, then the UDOO KEY Basic is for you: it mounts no sensors, so as to let you expand it with your favorite module. Otherwise, pick the UDOO KEY PRO.\n\nIn terms of pinout, the UDOO KEY is 100% compatible with Raspberry Pi Pico, both hardware and software-wise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMind you: all interfaces have ESD protection and are designed to be used not just by hobbyists, but also in industrial environments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks to the ESP32 on board, you get full WiFi 802.11b/g/n connectivity, Bluetooth\u00ae and BLE v4.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UDOO KEY needs 5V of power via USB-C and consumes very little.\nThe cool thing is, the board can go into deep sleep, reducing the power consumption to a minimum. In this state it only awakes if triggered by a specific event, enabling scenarios where you need the board to function for several years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UDOO KEY can be powered via battery pack.\nIn fact, it also supports a battery!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UDOO KEY is compatible with Raspberry Pi Pico, both hardware and software-wise. This means that each and any expansion hardware as well as each and any software built for Raspberry Pi Pico will work out of the box on UDOO KEY.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nESP32 is an incredibly versatile platform for Edge AI applications. It gives you lots of tools, demos and projects to start - and that's why we chose it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UDOO KEY opens the doors to Edge AI. Python, MicroPython, TinyML, TensorFlow Lite and much more: the sky's the limit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe love Arduino. In fact, we made UDOO KEY 100% compatible with Arduino software-wise.\nYes: UDOO KEY\u2019s Arduino IDE runs the Arduino IDE natively.\nThis means that each and any project that runs on Arduino Nano you can also run on UDOO KEY.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are strong believers and supporters of open-source technologies. Because of this, we are going to release the BOM and schematics of UDOO KEY as soon as we start shipping.\n\nThis is not an empty promise. We have already released the BOM and schematics of each and every UDOO board - have a look at our website.\n\nOn top of this, the core components of Clea are already open source:\n\n\n\u00a0Astarte\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Edgehog\n\u00a0\n\nLast but not least, we commit to open-source more Clea components in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make UDOO KEY even more flexible we are making available three special kits.\nThe first one is Early Bird UDOO KEY PRO Cam Kit + Clea.\n\n\n\n\n\nMade in collaboration with Arducam, it includes:\n\n1x UDOO KEY PRO\n1x 2MP SPI Camera\nAccess to Clea\n\n\n\nThe second kit is Early Bird UDOO KEY PRO Grove Kit + Clea.\n\n\n\n\n\nMade in collaboration with SeeedStudio, it includes:\n\n1x UDOO KEY PRO\n14 handpicked Grove Modules, including 5 sensors/ 5 actuators/ 2LED/ 1 LCD display/ 1 Grove shield\nAccess to Clea\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe third kit is Early Bird UDOO KEY PRO AI VISION KIT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMade in collaboration with Arducam, it includes:\n\nUDOO KEY PRO\nUDOO VISION X5, i.e. a powerful single-board computer for computational-intensive computer vision tasks at the edge\n1x 4K 8MP Autofocus USB camera\nAccess to Clea.\n\u00a0\n\nUDOO VISION X5 is the perfect companion for UDOO KEY.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a powerful x86 single-board computer based on an Intel\u00ae Atom\u00ae X5-E3940 Quad Core. The board is built upon a Pico-ITX pocket-size form factor, the ideal platform for computer vision projects. It features a 32-bit Quad-Channel LPDDR4 soldered on-board, 4GB of RAM and 32GB of eMMC.\nWhat\u2019s more, UDOO KEY is natively compatible with Clea and unlike other development boards, UDOO VISION X5 natively runs OpenVINO\u2122, a toolkit by Intel to quickly deploy computer vision and AI/ML apps at the edge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is not our first rodeo.\n\nWe\u2019ve already launched 4 successful Kickstarter campaigns - UDOO, UDOO NEO, UDOO X86, UDOO BOLT - raising over 2 million dollars from thousands of backers worldwide.\nSince the very first UDOO board we\u2019ve shipped over 100,000 single-board computers.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith UDOO DUAL/QUAD, our first single board computer launched on Kickstarter in 2013, we created a new playground for students to learn the basics of coding, electronics and physical computing with an all-in-one solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith UDOO NEO, our second single board computer launched on Kickstarter in 2015, we empowered makers, designers, startups and research groups all over the world with an IoT-ready all-in-one device for applications using motion sensors (rovers, drones, robots, automation).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith UDOO X86, launched on Kickstarter in 2016, we created the\u00a0most powerful single board computer of the time.\u00a0UDOO X86 addresses the needs of the average consumer that is looking for a very good, affordable media player, but also speaks to developers, makers and startups who want to invent today the world of tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0With UDOO BOLT, launched on Kickstarter in 2018, we created a portable and powerful computer featuring an AMD Ryzen\u2122\ufe0f Embedded V1000 SoC and an Arduino\u2122\ufe0f-compatible platform, all wrapped into one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUDOO is a joint effort of SECO Edge and SECO Mind, both daughter companies of SECO.\n\nSECO is a public company and a leading international player in the B2B embedded market. It has over 40 years of experience in the design and production of electronic embedded solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur community is a\u00a0strong point of the UDOO world.

And of course we added some great new features to make it the perfect all-round tool for any photographer!\n\n\n\n\n\nIN OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 WORDS\n\u201cUnleashed has changed my life. I have two, one for each Z7, use them to about 10% of their potential and they\u2019re still game-changing.\u201d - Josh H.\n\u201cI have been taking pictures for about 50 years and have seen and tried many technical solutions for remote control of cameras. This solution from Germany is so far the most sophisticated, elegant and at an unbeatable price I have found.\u201d - Blue Reef\n\u201cThis technology for camera control is amazing and so small. It puts all others practically out of the picture (no pun intended).\u201d - Dr. Stephen L.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause it can always stay on your camera and is never out of battery, the Unleashed is the perfect remote control, be it for simple triggering of tripod shots, family photos or selfies. Or use it to remotely start & stop video recording - when your camera is mounted on a gimbal or you want to start multiple cameras at once. The Unleashed app can handle up to 6 cameras with ease.\nBut it\u2019s so much more than just a remote - with the Unleashed you can change all the important settings of your camera, without having to touch your camera or dig through daunting menus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve all come to love geotagged photos on our smartphones, where you can easily find photos on a map in the \u201cplaces\u201d album, as well as check the exact location of individual shots. The Unleashed enables direct in-camera geotagging for your mirrorless camera or DSLR, using either your smartphone\u2019s location or a dedicated Bluetooth GPS receiver.\n\n\n\nRelive your vacation when browsing the photos of your trip on a map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAstrophotography, lightpainting and more\nOur long exposure feature helps you take perfectly timed exposures up to 4.5 hours. When the camera is set to bulb mode, the Unleashed will hold the trigger down for you for the exact time you want it to. Or you can press once to start and press again to stop a long exposure of any length. We decided on continuing the scale of 1/3rd stop steps from the camera instead of you having to set hours, minutes and seconds separately. While it\u2019s unconventional, this makes it much easier to work with the other exposure settings in the camera: Take test shots with high ISO to nail exposure, then decrease ISO and easily increase exposure time by an equal number of stops to keep the same exposure level.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nMilky Way by Derek Sturman @dereksturmanphotography\n\n\nND filter photography\nWe also added a setting that will adjust the shutter speed for you by the right number of stops when adding or removing ND filters, making ND filter calculators obsolete!\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Unleashed makes setting up any timelapse a breeze, whether simple or requiring expert features. And we implemented lots of them!\nJust use our default settings and hit start or choose your interval and shooting time - it\u2019s that easy! We\u2019ll show you the number of photos it\u2019ll take, as well as the resulting clip length at your chosen frame rate. You can also decide to choose the number of photos to take, and we\u2019ll calculate the shooting time for you instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nReal exposure ramping\u00a0\nThe Unleashed brings \u201choly grail\u201d timelapses within reach for everyone. During these day-to-night transition timelapses, the Unleashed will adjust exposure settings automatically, using one of several algorithms to choose from. We\u2019re not limited to bulb-ramping, but can actually ramp the camera\u2019s shutterspeed, aperture and ISO for daylight to milkyway transitions.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimized dark-time\nAll normal intervalometers have unnecessarily long autofocussing and hold times. The former is how long the shutter button is half-pressed before the interval, the latter how long it is fully pressed and held on each interval. These times need to be long enough to ensure a photo is taken, with or without AF. So to be on the safe side, intervalometers usually half-press, then press and hold for way too long. This results in unwanted \u201cdark-time\u201d between shots where nothing useful happens, but you also can\u2019t view the photos. Some more advanced intervalometers allow you to change the hold time, but this puts the burden on you to find the shortest possible but longest necessary time that will consistently work with your camera. The Unleashed knows whether the camera is set to autofocus, and on most cameras it gets the info exactly when the shutter opens. So it will only half-press when necessary and can stop holding the shutter button the instant we know the camera started the shot, leading to the absolute minimal dark-time for every camera, with no configuration necessary.\u00a0\n\nFlexible intervals\nSo you don\u2019t miss any shots when exposure times get longer, the Unleashed can optionally start increasing the interval. This is perfect for day-to-night timelapses as it enables you to have a nice short interval during the day, but still allows ramping down to 30s exposures for starry nights.\n\n\n\nUnleashed in its element with Mike Ver Sprill - @milky_way_mike\n\n\nMonth-long durations\nYou can now set intervals of up to 24h and shooting times up to 365 days!\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nExternal intervalometer support\nOur autoramping will optionally work with external intervalometers, even sliders and other motion controllers.\n\n\n\nBlack Forest Motion PINE R controlled by Unleashed\n\n\nSync timelapses with the movement of motion controllers\nBecause the Unleashed knows exactly when a shot ends, it can tell motion controllers to move with perfect timing, in order to maximise the time until the next shot and therefore minimize vibrations. This will work wirelessly with selected manufacturers. We have already implemented support for the Black Forest Motion PINE controllers and are currently working on Syrp compatibility, with more to follow. With most cameras it will also work with a wired shutter cable from any other motion controller and the Unleashed set to external intervalometer.\n\nFoolproof and fail-safe\nAll basic and advanced features are implemented in the Unleashed firmware, and the app just provides the user interface to configure them. Once started, the Unleashed keeps controlling the camera with precision and without missing a beat, even if you lose Bluetooth connectivity. Precise timing, complex \"holy grail\" calculations and camera adjustments are handled by the Unleashed itself, not the app! Even the Bluetooth connection to a motion controller is direct and independent from the smartphone. Of course you can open the app and reconnect at any time to see the current progress or make manual adjustments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGallery and photo review - now in HD\nThe new Unleashed got 10x faster. So you can now transfer high-resolution preview images to your phone! You can enable automatic downloading for quick review after each shot you take, and you can browse all photos in our new gallery view. The Unleashed quickly loads all thumbnails and you can choose to download your favorites in higher resolutions individually. To get the most out of the Bluetooth bandwidth, we added smart comparison algorithms to avoid unnecessary data transfers. We even implemented complex methods to add the EXIF data of the original image to the high-resolution previews you\u2019re downloading! Because your GPS metadata along with all other shooting info is in the preview images when you save those to your camera roll, you\u2019ll be able to see and search for those photos conveniently on a map in your \u201cPlaces\u201d album.\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on location\nEasily share your favorite shots taken with your camera right from our app. The new high resolution previews are perfect for sharing on Social Media or with your family and friends right on the spot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have a loooong wish list of our customers\u2019 feature wishes for the Unleashed and our app. Reaching the following funding goals will enable us to develop some of these requests. So spread the news, tell your friends and together we\u2019ll make these cool features become a reality!\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the last two stretch goals don\u2019t guarantee we will be able to provide full support for all features on these camera brands! We still have too much R&D ahead of us to promise this. Also, as already written elsewhere, we only have a chance to support these Olympus cameras: OM-D E-M1 III, E-M5 III, E-M1X and E-M1 Mark II and these Pentax cameras: 645Z, K1, K1 Mark II and maybe the K3, KP and K3 Mark II. You can read the reasoning behind that in our FAQs.\n\n\n\n\n\nExtended exposure bracketing.\nWhen we say extended, we mean it. With the Unleashed, you can take exposure bracketed shots with up to 55 images and any EV stepsize: 0.3, 0.7, 1.0, 2.0\u2026 you name it. Set up your starting exposure, and select whether you want symmetric bracketing, only darker exposures, or just brighter exposures. Choose whether to bracket exposure by changing shutterspeed, aperture or ISO - or any combination thereof, in the order you choose! Set maximum and minimum for each of these settings, to keep your bracketed shots shorter, avoid noise or limit depth of field variation and diffraction. You have full control!\nCapture scenes with high dynamic range to create HDR photos with tone mapping or exposure fusion. Or use it for image-based lighting of 3D renderings to realistically place 3D objects into the real world.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new Unleashed '22 is compatible with 144 camera models. To fit all those different cameras, there will be 7 different Unleashed models, as well as 7 different cables to perfectly and snugly fit on your camera.\u00a0Each Unleashed model is a mere 14x16x5.5mm in size (0.54 x 0.63 x 0.20 in, w x h x d, without the plug) and weighs less than 5g.\u00a0The cables are custom made with extremely flexible wires and the smallest possible right-angled plugs to make sure they never get in your way.\n\nN1 and N2 have Nikon specific 10 pin plugs and come with an optional USB cable. This is available with 4 different USB plugs: USB-C, USB-Micro, USB-Mini and USB-8P\nM1 has a USB-C plug that\u2019s reversible\nM2 and M3 have USB-Micro plugs and\u00a0\nM4 and M5 have USB-Mini plugs\nAll M models come with an HDMI cable. This is available with 3 different HDMI plugs: HDMI-A (Full-size), HDMI-C (Mini-HDMI), HDMI-D (Micro-HDMI).\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make it easier, all we need to know is which camera you want the Unleashed for, and we\u2019ll make sure you get the right Unleashed + cable combination. Just back this project and pledge to support us today, and a few weeks before shipping we\u2019ll send you a survey through our pledge manager where you can specify your camera along with shipping details to get your reward.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following cameras are supported.

From our own experience and for the vast majority of people we have talked to, the manufacturers apps are so frustrating to use, that few people will bother making a second attempt of getting the apps to work, let alone use them productively in the field. The biggest gripes everyone has with these apps is getting them to connect to the camera reliably. The Unleashed is the complete opposite: Even initial pairing only takes seconds, and reconnection in every day use happens instantly when you open the app.\u00a0\nCheck out a real-time comparison between the Unleashed versus the manufacturers' native apps from initial connection to first photo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've used a lot of remote triggers, but the Unleashed is by far my favorite. It's so small and unobtrusive that it nests inside my camera's L-bracket and I love the fact it needs no batteries or charging. The app has an intuitive, modern, well-designed interface.\u00a0With the latest updates, it's a dream to use for low light remote triggering and complex timelapse. I\u2019m really looking forward to all the features of the new Unleashed.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Shutter release remotes are one of the essential components to sharp night sky images, so naturally I have used a lot of them. Some would call me a destroyer of equipment on the many trips I drag it through, so I\u2019ve jumped from remote to remote for years.\u00a0Well, since I\u2019ve had the Unleashed that\u2019s changed. Ever since I\u2019ve had it, I haven\u2019t used another remote at all, honestly. The thing just lives on my camera, I don\u2019t think it has left my camera body even once since the day I got it. The greatest part about it is that I no longer have to constantly worry about forgetting to bring a shutter remote, or losing it along the way. I remember the constant stress of bringing batteries or forgetting them on multi day backpacking trips for other remotes. What is great about this remote is it uses your camera\u2019s battery (which I have not noticed any difference in battery life) and now I can just focus on bringing camera batteries and keeping my phone charged which I would be doing anyway! I\u2019ve also used a lot of the standard camera bluetooth apps like nikon's snap bridge and would go as far as to say that I am not alone in disliking them. The interface of the Unleashed app is easy to use and very effective. It\u2019s also so nice to finally have an app that has real usable timelapse functions.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For me, the thing I like about the Unleashed the most might be different than one would think. I love how easily I can use my camera remotely from my phone. I can control/change almost all settings from the palm of my hand. Since I do a lot of astrophotography and long exposure stuff, it really makes that so much easier for me. A lot of times I need to be able to start my camera and do light painting. I can set up a 2 or 10 second delay on my phone, hit start, put my phone in my pocket, wait for it to start taking the picture and do my light painting. It helps a lot more than one would think.\nIt's also very nice to be able to take \"selfies\" with something other than a cell phone when there's not generally people around that can run the camera for you. I have taken many family pictures with it remotely that don't look like they were set up on a tripod. I love the timelapse and holy grail timelapse features as well. I really like that I can see visually what multiple cameras are doing at any time throughout the timelapse too. I think my favorite \"moments\" I have with using them is taking my own astroselfies or self-family pictures. I don't always get the opportunity to be in the pictures because I'm usually the one with the camera taking the pictures. But with The Unleashed I can remotely control them, from a decent distance and even view the images if need be. It makes getting in front of the camera much easier and be part of the memories I'm creating.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Hey all my name is Josh Morgan and I\u2019m a rural electrician from New Zealand with a keen interest on Astro Photography and Timelapse. So I took a punt on the Unleashed in early 2020 to hopefully assist me with my timelapse work. After a long Covid wait it arrived and I couldn\u2019t be more happy with it. Really transformed my D750 into a more modern machine, gave me extended long shutter durations for crazy long exposures, GPS tagging and more importantly full time exposure ramping shutter/aperture/iso for full time holy grail timelapse work which had been a sore point for me as I had to manually ramp every setting during sunset/sunrise which has its own problems if I was tryna run 2 cameras. But also more importantly it runs off Bluetooth which was critical to me as any wifi related systems absolutely chewed up battery life on the camera. So a very welcomed bonus and so far a hell of a product.\nMy favourite moment so far with the Unleashed is it finally allowed me to capture amazing holy grail timelapse work coming into our prime Astro season at my holiday destination of choice Great Barrier Island. What I managed to capture was some of the most intense levels of airglow I\u2019ve ever encountered. I have family/time constraints there so having the Unleashed work hands off was really amazing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoolography GmbH, founded in 2009, is an international team located in Berlin, Germany, making use of the city\u2019s great network and drive for technological innovation. Being engineers and photographers ourselves, we live and breathe our products. The Unleashed is not just another commercial product, it's our baby! We use it all the time and have devoted countless hours refining every detail for the smoothest operation in all edge cases. To do so, we reverse engineered protocols and learned to control every possible bit of the cameras! This translates to a hassle-free user experience which really sets the Unleashed apart. In an update we'll do a tech deep dive with the founder to highlight a few of those. Stay tuned!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Unleashed is made in Germany and is the product of some serious German engineering! Of course some components are sourced abroad, but the Unleashed is designed, developed and manufactured in Germany.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve actively been working toward this new Unleashed for the better part of the last two years. In fact, to pave the way for the new features of the Unleashed \u201822, we refactored so much code that we found and fixed quite a few bugs in rare edge cases and made huge improvements to nearly all features of the Unleashed \u201818 along the way. After a long beta testing phase, we just released all these in a major 2.0.0 update of our Apps for iOS and Android including the 2.0.0 Firmware. So not only does the new Unleashed benefit hugely from all the R&D we did on the Unleashed \u201818, the reverse is true as well.\nOne of the most important things we learned from the last campaign: no matter how well you plan, you\u2019ll always need more time! So we're only starting this campaign now that we got the Unleashed fully functional on all new brands. The current lead times for components are making it virtually impossible to promise a shorter delivery time, so we have not just included some buffers into our timeline - basically our entire timeline is buffer!\u00a0So while we gear up for production and wait for components to arrive, we\u2019ll have all that time to really polish all the new features.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the campaign, a few weeks before we ship the Unleashed, you will get access to our pledge management system (via email) where you can pay for optional express shipping, buy additional Unleasheds or other accessories.\u00a0\nShipping costs are: Germany: 8\u20ac, Rest of World: 15\u20ac, express shipping can be added optionally.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe really appreciate your help in getting word out about the new Unleashed, be it to your photography buddies, your followers on Social Media or a media outlet you happen to work for \ud83d\ude09. Feel free to reach out to press@foolography.com or come have a look at www.foolography.com/press.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nOliver and his Dad on their photowalk through Berlin\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 2,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $900M raised between them.\n\n\n"

A common problem we see with smart home setups is that family members often don't understand how to control it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nFlic Twist is our dream of a perfect smart home controller. It bridges the gap between advanced users and tech-averse family members.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPush and Rotate are easy to use and understand. Unlock advanced modes by pushing and rotating at the same time.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaster controller in the hallway\n\n\n\n\n\nLights and blinds in the bedroom\n\n\n\n\n\nMusic and color in the studio\n\n\n\n\n\nFun and function in the kid's room\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMount it on the wall using the included magnetic wall mount with screws or adhesive, or put it on your table. Flic Twist has no wires and requires no installation. Two AAA batteries last up to 2 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlic Twist introduces four functions never before seen in Smart Home: Smart Dimming, Advanced Dimming, Scene Blender and Selector.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSee examples and demos of these innovations further down! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Flic Hub Mini is a tiny yet powerful computer that takes your Flic Twist input and creates magic with your smart home devices. The optimized long range communication works on distances of up to 50m (150ft), makes the battery of Twist last for over 2 years, and has a ultrafast latency of less than 0.1 second. A blink of an eye takes 0.1 to 0.4 seconds.\n\n\n\nFlic Hub is the brains behind it all. Read more about the new Flic Hub Mini further down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*The Flic Hub operates locally and only needs internet connectivity if you connect an integration that requires it, such as IFTTT, Zapier, Alexa, or SmartThings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are part of the unifying smart home standard Matter that will bring all ecosystems and devices together when it rolls out in 2022.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWe are committed to making Flic products work with the entire Matter ecosystem, via a Flic Hub. \n\n\nWith Matter allowing products to work seamlessly with each other, you can focus on building a smarter home and Flic Twist will allow your family to enjoy it. Matter is however not a requirement for using Flic Twist with your favorite brands.\n\n\n\nEven if you have these connected to something else (e.g. Google Home, Homekit, or Alexa), a Flic Hub can control them in parallel with your current setup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Flic Hub LR or a Flic Hub Mini is required. Flic Hub Mini can be added in the checkout. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Flic Twist comes in two colors that fit into any interior. Select your color after the campaign in the post-campaign survey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur last three products Flic 1, Flic Hub, and Flic 2, were created thanks to you and people like you.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWe invented the Smart Button and now we\u2019re back again with a new innovation for smart home control!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmart Dimming just works. You can apply it to any existing setup in two simple steps: select the parameter (like brightness, volume, or window blind position) and the devices you want to control. Smart Dimming adjusts each parameter individually, maintaining the relative differences between devices. Even if you go all the way up or down, you will always be able to get back to where you were.\nIt also plays along nicely with other means of control, like voice commands or other apps. If something changes, Smart Dimming will observe and adapt to be ready for making smooth adjustments the next time you use it.\n\n\n\nThe relationship between the lights is kept while you dim the lights, even if you change the lights from an app or a voice assistant.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt works the same way for controlling the volume on smart speakers. Rotate to adjust volume in the same room. Push-Rotate to adjust volume on all speakers.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusting window blinds is just as easy with Smart Dimming.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen showing the current status the LEDs start lighting up at 6 o'clock and light up clockwise until they reach 5 o'clock which represents 100%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Dimming works the same way as Smart Dimming but with much more options. When rotating you can adjust brightness, color, or saturation simultaneously. Sequence the lights and even add events.\n\n\n\nIn the above example we add a sequence at 50%. When rotating up to 50%, only Colored Light 1 and 2 are controlled.  When you pass 50% the LIFX mini color starts lighting up and also toggles an IKEA wall plug and triggers an Alexa Routine.\n\n\nAdvanced Dimming Example 1: Adjust brightness and color temperature simultaneously\n\n\n\nAdvanced Dimming can increase the color temperature from an evening friendly Warm-White color to a Daylight-White while you are increasing the brightness. \n\n\n\n\n\nDemo of adjusting brightness and color temperature simultaneously using Philips Hue lights. \n\n\nAdvanced Dimming Example 2: Sequencing\n\n\n\nUse Advanced Dimming to turn on different lights in sequence one after the other. \n\n\n\n\n\n Demo of Light sequencing using the Advanced Dimming mode. \n\n\nAdvanced Dimming Example 3: Combine Sequencing with brightness and color temperature\u00a0\n\n\n\nGo from darkness to a cozy warm color and then to a full brightness with energizing daylight color while turning the ceiling lights on half way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlic Twist's innovative Scene Blender mode allows you to preset up to 4 different light scenes. It fades smoothly between your scenes so you can select just the level in between that fits your mood for the moment.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe software blends intelligently between brightness, hue, saturation, number of lights, window blinds level, and anything else you want to include in your scenes. The result is a smooth experience of sliding between moods and scenes in your home that all family members will love to use. \n\n\nScene Blender Example 1: Blend Scenes and Adjust Brightness\nUse Smart Dimming on Rotate and Scene Blender on Push-Rotate. This allows you to blend between your scenes and then Rotate to fine-tune the brightness of your scene to perfection.\u00a0\n\nScene Blender Example 2: Shift Music between rooms or to the entire house\nOn each of the 4 scenes you can set each speaker volume to 25%. Push-Rotate to blend between the scenes which will shift the music from one room to another or to the entire house. Use rotate to adjust the volume of the selected speakers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Selector allows you to select up to 12 custom things to Activate or Adjust.\u00a0Each position is referred to as clock positions in the app, 1 to 12 o'clock.\n\n\n\n\n\nThings you can Adjust\nThis allows you to select and adjust the settings of a specific room, the entire house or just a specific device that you want to adjust with Smart Dimming.\nFor example, Push-Rotate to:\n\n\u00a012 o\u2019clock: Now you can rotate to adjust the bedroom lights.\n\u00a01 o\u2019clock: Now you can rotate to adjust volume on all speakers\n\u00a02 o\u2019clock: Now you can rotate to adjust only the bedroom window light.\u00a0\n\nThings you can Activate\nYou predefine your actions and simply execute them.\u00a0\nFor example, Push-Rotate to:\n\n\u00a03 o\u2019clock: Activates an Alexa Routine\n\u00a04 o\u2019clock: Starts playing Jazz in the Kitchen\n\u00a05 o\u2019clock: Opens all blinds\n\nFor even more advanced things you can also Activate custom internet requests, Zapier or IFTTT actions and more.\n\u00a0\nAdaptive fields\nDepending on the number of actions you set the indicator lights will adapt accordingly. Selecting only two fields will be referred to as Left and Right. Selecting up to four fields will be referred to according to the image below.\n\n\n\nWhen you use the Selector with up to 4 fields, each field is referred to as Up, Down, Left and Right as the example above. Choosing more will refer to each of the 12 positions instead, from 1 to 12 o'clock. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen using the Scene Blender or Selector it can be helpful to visualize the scenes or functions that have been set to the different positions. The icon sticker-pack add-on comes with a wide variety of different icons to help visualize your scenes.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe icon sticker pack is a pack of 35 different icons. The Sticker Alignment Template is included with each icon sticker pack and helps you place the icons on the correct position.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlic 2 buttons are included in some of the rewards and can be added as add-ons. Flic 2 was successfully launched here on Kickstarter in 2019 and has since then been continuously improved. Flic 2 can trigger anything that Flic Twist can trigger, but it's just a button without the rotation of Flic Twist. You can assign 3 different triggers to Push, Double Push and Hold.\u00a0It's really small, wireless and comes with an adhesive that allows you to place it anywhere. Flic 2 runs on a replaceable and included coincell battery, CR2032, that lasts up to two years.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSome of many 5-star reviews of Flic 2 and the Flic apps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlic Twist complements Flic buttons with more powerful features and they fit great together! \n\n\nFlic Twist and the Flic Hub Mini are fully backwards compatible with Flic Hub and Flic 2.\u00a0\n\nUse Flic Twist with your existing Flic Hub\nUse Flic buttons with the new Flic Hub Mini\n\nBoth Flic Hub LR and Flic 2 buttons will continue to be sold and maintained.\n\nFlic Hub Comparison table\n\n\n\nIn this campaign we are only offering the new Flic Hub Mini. If you're interested in the Flic Hub LR you can upgrade your pledge after the campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Flic App for iOS and Android is only required when you set up your Flic Twist for the first time, and if you want to change your settings later. All settings that you make in the app are stored locally in the Flic Hub.\u00a0\n\nStep by Step\u00a0\nIn the below video we demonstrate the simplicity of adding a Flic Hub and a Flic Twist to the Flic app to start configuring it.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the below video we demonstrate how your existing smart home products, in this case, a Philips Hue lightbulb, are added to the Flic app to be controlled with the Flic Twist.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the below video we show our test bench walking through the setup process step by step and demo the current state of the app and development.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a hacker, you never settle with the features that come out of the box. Flic has always been about empowering customers and provide a way to integrate our product into your personal projects. With HTTP integrations you can add smooth controls to just about anything that runs an HTTP server like your Raspberry Pi-controlled nerf gun turret. Twist to aim and push to shoot with unmatched precision.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe one thing we knew before starting the design journey was that Flic Twist needed the ability to rotate. The majority of smart dimmers on the market have Up and Down buttons which are not user-friendly if you\u2019re for example increasing the brightness from 10 to 100%.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe evaluated and tested different designs and realized that separating the button and rotation gives the best user experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tested a variety of different sizes, from small knobs that you twist with your fingertips to large pucks that you rotate with your entire hand. After more than 10 design iterations we finally settled on the perfect size for the button and the rotating dial which is convenient to use for the entire family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlic Twist\nThe Flic Twist is designed with the same Nordic Semiconductor chipset as the Flic 2 button which has Long Range features that give an indoor range of up to 50m. It comes with two replaceable AAA batteries that last up to 2 years.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nFlic Hub Mini\nThe new Flic Hub Mini is a very optimized design of our already existing product Flic Hub LR. It uses Bluetooth 5 Low Energy Long Range to communicate with Flic Twist or with other Flic products. One Flic Hub Mini can handle over 60 simultaneous connections to Flic products such as Flic Twist and Flic buttons over a range of up to 50m (150ft). Flic Hub Mini then communicates with your smart home devices using WiFi.\u00a0There are no limits in how many devices a Flic Hub can control using WiFi.\u00a0\n\nA Flic Hub Mini or a Flic Hub LR are required, even if you use Flic Twist with Matter. The interaction is in the twist, and the brains and logic are in the hub. This setup allows Flic products to be extremely fast and battery efficient, while offering functions that no other products have, still with full privacy.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe new Flic Hub Mini is much smaller and more affordable than it's predecessors. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEverything you need to get started is included. Each Flic Twist comes with 2x AAA batteries and wall mount included. The Flic Hub Mini comes with the USB cable included.

The strong community that supports us in our mission by using our products day by day proved that our products bring value to the life of people.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWe'd love to invite you to join our community in the Flic Family. If you share our mission and what we are doing, back our product and help us to bring simplicity to the tech scene.\n\nMission\nShortcut Labs has been developing the Flic product for 8 years now. Our goal is to bring simplicity to the life of all tech users, from geeks to toddlers. Using your voice or various devices to control your smart home can become frustrating, tiresome, and anti-social. Voice is an excellent tool, but it does not work in all situations.\u00a0\nWith Flic Twist, we add more options to your hands yet retain the simplicity of the original Flic button. In addition, with Flic Twist, we hope that we can engage all your family members and guests to interact with your smart home while giving you more options to control your smart home.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Journey\nJoacim, one of the Co-Founders of Flic, looked for a simpler way to track his nicotine consumption, so he decided to bring Flic to life. Shortcut Labs was founded in 2013 to create a simple interface - the world's first smart button. The first version of Flic was a great success, as almost ten thousand people backed its campaign.\n\nSince the first Flic, we have completed two other successful crowdfunding campaigns. We have shipped over half a million Flic products to 85 countries around the world. Flic integrates with hundreds of technologies we all use daily. Every Flic user has a story to tell about how they use their button. From helping them start their morning routines to be the guardian that keeps their home safe, there are thousands of innovative and imaginative ways Flic is used. But underneath all of them, one thing always remains the same - Flic makes life simple. A shortcut and a life hack that brings smiles to millions of faces every day. Help us make Flic Twist a part of this journey and spread simplicity to even more people worldwide.\n\nPrivacy Policy\nWe take your privacy very seriously. This mindset is also relevant for Flic products. Our products do not have microphones, nor cameras. You can read our current Privacy Policy here.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe global supply chain is still recovering after the pandemic, and the prices right now are unusually high and unreliable. To avoid the current shipping costs we will not charge you for shipping now but instead wait until we are ready to ship your rewards. \u00a0\n\nShipping Costs will be charged upon shipping, there will be low cost postal and faster express options in the post-campaign survey.\n\nTaxes and Customs\nYour reward will be shipped either from the EU or the US depending on where you are. For EU and US, all taxes and duties are included in the rewards. For all other countries, taxes and duties may apply.\n\nWe can ship to over 100+ countries, except the countries and territories listed below\n\n\n\nIf you live in one of the countries or territories listed above we probably will not be able to ship to that destination. Feel free to reach out to us to verify.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We can promise that the shipping fee we charge will be no more than 18% of most regions (no more than 25% for Australia and New Zealand), we will cover the excess part if it costs more.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\nThe safety class of xTool M1 is Class I (FDA Certified).

We launched our first project on Kickstarter, and thanks to the amazing Kickstarter community and our backers, we've been able to grow our business to where it is today - a company with over 300 employees...\nFrom \"one robot per child\", our mission never altered. We continue to empower kids to enjoy the fun of creating.\nThis time around, with xTool M1, we want to bring powerful tools to everyone who enjoys doing things themselves. This first-of-its-kind machine is low-barrier, compact, and affordable.\nThe most important thing is not that we're presenting the world's first desktop hybrid laser & blade cutter and engraver, but that we always aimed to \"WOW\" our backers with our products.\nWe\u2019re so grateful for all of your support along the way.

Our brand\u2019s story started with a lot of love and a little inspiration (\u201cHow can we make it easier and safer for kids to enjoy creating?\u201d). The brand concept of xTool was born in 2018 and we launched the first xTool LaserBox in 2019. From there, our mission has been to help people turn their creativity into reality (and have fun doing it)!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are also proud of our industrial design and have won numerous awards.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe do not brag about ourselves but enjoy a word-of-mouth reputation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were named one\u00a0of\u00a0\u00a0ProductHype's\u00a0 Best Kickstarter Projects of 2021."

There are hundreds of books/websites about it and everybody knows our 9 planets and how they are arranged, right?\u00a0After all, we should have learned that in school...\n\n\n\n\n\nMany of us still remember the mnemonic:\u00a0\n\"My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Nine Pizzas\" or as we say here in Germany: \"Mein Vater Erkl\u00e4rt Mir Jeden Sonntag Unsere Neun Planeten\". \u00a0\u00a0\nWith this help, many of us can at least list the planets correctly...\nMars, Venus, Earth, Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, right?\u00a0Almost! Pluto was assumed to be a planet but does not identify itself as such anymore and Mercury comes before Mars, \u00a0but the most crucial fact is:\n\nThat most of us never understood the true differences in size and distances between the planets, because most representations are not true to scale.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a strong laser, we shoot tiny cracks into the glass. We laser our Sun + 9 Planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, Uranus, and the hypothetical Planet 9 into our famous Spheres. We also want to picture the 9 Moons: Ganymede, Callisto, Io, Europa, Rhea, Titan, Iapetus, Triton, and our Moon Moon (Luna).\n\n\n\nPhoto: Prototype II Solar System Sphere + New LED Base\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: Sun, Earth, and Moon in our Solar System Prototype II\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: Jupiter and Saturn with moons\n\n\nThe Sun in our Sphere will be 4cm, the largest Planet 4mm, and the smallest Moon 0.1mm, which is barely visible to the naked eye and even more difficult for our camera.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRendering\n\n\nNot everyone might be a fan of our scaled representation\u00a0of the Solar System, so we consider offering different versions of it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0We also want to offer a 9 Planet Cube Set, containing a planet each with a size of 3x3x3cm.\n\n\n\nRendering: Planet Cubes\n\n\n\nYou can try to place these small cubes at the right distances to the Solar Sphere, but this might be more difficult than thought. Why?\n\n\n\nPhoto: Micro Cube Prototype I\n\n\nBecause although they are so small in our Sphere you can barely see Earth, they would be ridiculously far away. There is probably no one in the world who could throw our Neptune regarding our Sphere onto its Orbit. \u00a0Even Saturn is challenging but doable.\u00a0Challenge accepted?\u00a0\n\n\n\nPlease don\u00b4t throw your cubes, they are hard to find, breakable, and might hurt like hell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRendering\n\n\nAfter what felt like eons of searching for a good LED base that is stylish, functional, and affordable, we finally found one. Of course, the bases we've offered so far work flawlessly and even wirelessly, but they lack some features and don't completely light up our models the way I want them to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto/Gif: Spheres + New LED Base\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: Prototypes Planet cubes + Prototype II Solar Sphere + New LED Base\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: 9-Set Earthling + Earthling in a Sphere Week 12 + New LED Base\n\n\nWith the new LED bar, our spheres and small cubes can be illuminated perfectly.

You can even pair the LED with any TV so that the colors match the TV program.\u00a0\n\n\n\nPhoto/Gif\n\n\n\u00a0I am very delighted.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs in our previous campaigns, we would like to present many interesting facts about our models in our updates. Maybe we will also make a small booklet again.\nFor example: Did you know that the ice giants Neptune and Uranus are not cold at all? The atmosphere consists of a hydrogen-methane mixture that becomes a hot fluid due to the enormous pressure. Further inside, phenomena like hail and even whole icebergs of Diamonds are suspected. But then why are they called ice giants? \u00a0\nFind out in our updates!\n\n\n\n\n\nBut we also want to write about the habitable zones, the moons, and the immense distance the planets are apart.\n\n\n\nOverview: Solar System\n\n\nWithin the campaign, we will explain the differences between our planned models and the different shapes and sizes of our products.\n\n\n\nRendering: Size comparison regular Sphere\n\n\n\n\n\nRendering: regular Sphere, big Sphere, Planet Cubes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRendering: Planet Cubes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Even though our Star Constellation Sphere with its 5068 stars and 88 constellations already fits really nicely into the series...\n\n\n\nPhoto: Star Constellations Sphere 3D\n\n\n\n...the Solar System Sphere with its Sun, Planets, and Moons truly completes our Universe Sphere series. Thus, the individual lasered points symbolize either planets or Moons, Stars, or entire Galaxies, depending on the Sphere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will design Solar System Coasters and hand them out to our first 1000 backers for free. There will be a set of 2x10 coasters - Our Sun + 9 Planets, \u00a0so you can also play memory. \u00a0We got some more ideas, so stay tuned!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll products can also be added and purchased via our add-on store, such as old and new products, LED Bases, and the Early Bird Planet Coasters.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn campaigns from other creators, we have seen that shipping fees are often collected after the campaign. This has several advantages for you and us and therefore we decided to do the same.\u00a0\n\nBut don't worry, because of the many previous campaigns we made, we can estimate the maximum costs very well, so there are no nasty surprises waiting for you.\nAdvantages:\u00a0\n\nWe can renegotiate the shipping cost when we create a large order.\nWe can calculate the shipping costs more fair if you order add-ons (there were some difficulties with that in the past)\nWe can save a part of the Kickstarter fee, which is normally also deducted from the shipping costs. But since we don't make any profit on the shipping costs, we find that fair enough. and can save you some money at best.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, we have a professional fulfillment partner, but in the beginning, I still packed 4000 packages by hand with my father and my brother.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt all started with me, Clemens, and my wedding actually.

The campaign was a complete success and motivated me to design more such models. From this, the company CinkS labs was born and meanwhile, we have a couple of employees who support me with my projects.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur first priority is our scientific approach. We\u00b4re conducting adequate research, we enlist the help of relevant scientists and try to figure out what will work best for our glass pieces. For the planets as an example, the difficulty is to not just laser a white ball into the glass but to make the structure visible.\n\nWe design and model our 3D images to laser-etch them into the glass with the highest precision. You can hardly see the microscopic dots with the naked eye.\u00a0\nThe dots are in fact not air bubbles, as many people think, but tiny cracks that reflect light differently at varying angles due to their elongated shape. These are created by heat pulses emitted by a focused laser several thousand times per second.\nWe made a short video of our laser process for a previous campaign, \"The Microcosm in a Sphere\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, we do have copycats, but with stark differences in quality.\nOur original Spheres offer solid optical grade glass with high resolution, scientifically accurate models and are available in 8cm as well as an unreached above average size of 15cm. \u00a0Made in - and shipped from Germany.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis timeline represents something like the bad case.

These numbers are reflected as people started to gain interest in taking care of their outer looks, accelerating the growth of the men's grooming market. This phenomenon will grow the demands for shaving products and the whole men's grooming market in general. And the beauty industry, like these, will focus more on the detailing section of men's beauty. Amongst all the possible products, nose hair trimming is one of them.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople seldomly use nose hair trimmers instead of using their hands, scissors, or wax to take care of their nose hair. But they do not seem to satisfy the user's expectations most of the time. Instead of actually trimming your nose hair, plucking is not going to fill your needs anymore. And nonetheless, plucking your nose hair is very dangerous.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere may be times where the sharp blades might poke and scratch the inside of your nose. Experts warn the public that nose hair plucking is quite dangerous. The assistant professor for ENT at the Columbia University Medical Center, Jason A Moche, stated that since the human nose sucks in dust every day in a vacuum, plucking one's nose hair might put the individual at risk of infection.\n\n\n\n\"GQ\", https://www.gq.com/story/nose-hair-trimmer-grooming-ask-an-expert\n\n\nAn individual might look very appealing Just by keeping yourself clean and calm. With M-9's light, portable, simple, and curvy dome-shaped design, users are free from the threat of hurting themselves due to the absence of a mirror. The world's first ergonomically designed dome-shaped design will keep you safe and slick. Meet the innovative nose hair trimmer M-9 that will make you the gentlemen you dream of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3rd Planet Techies\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMR GADGET\n\n\n\u3164\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u3164\n\n\n\n\n\nWe all have hurt the inside of our nose trying to pluck out our nose hair with sharp scissors or tweezers. \u00a0But they do not really get the job done and hurt our nose badly.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe M-9 was designed with ergonomics and safety in mind with its dome-shaped structure, making the blades invisible externally. With its soft curved line finish, the users will not feel uncomfortable, and they will also be free from the threats of a sharp blade. Also, by coating the dome-shaped nets with nickel, it is upgraded to ensure our user's safety and sanitation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dome-shaped structure brings another level of safety by preventing the blades from making direct contact with any parts of our body. Also, since it was designed with a dome shape, it prevents the users from accidentally sticking the device deeply inside their noses. (Providing a more comfortable shaving/trimming experience)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dome-shaped heads and their blades provide a super high precision cutting, drastically decreasing the chances of pinching or scratching the skin. Also, since it is made with stainless steel, the M-9 is extraordinarily durable and economical, with no need for frequent replacements to be made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen removing nose hair, the highest priority is how fast and precisely you can remove them.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe M-9 is upgraded with the 8700 RPM motor from the 7100 RPM Motor from M-7(our previous model). With this upgrade, the M-9 is equipped with the most powerful motor, providing a more delicate and precise trimming with a high-speed centrifugal cut.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM-9 is only 12.5X2.5X2.5cm and 54g big. Due to its lightweight and size that would perfectly fit in our palms, the M-9 is way lighter than other electric shavers. The M-9 also comes with its own carrying case, enabling users to carry it around to keep their fresh looks.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, there is no need for extra charging. A AA battery is good enough to provide power for prolong usage. It will take care of your hair with just a touch of a button\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrooming is needed for every part of your body. The M-9's usage is not only limited to nose hair but, it can also be used for ears, mustache, eyebrows, and sideburns. If you have that cool mustache then, design it with more precision. They can all be done without expert help if you have M-9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs this is a product that is inserted in our nose, we took extra precautions on sanitation. The M-9 is splash-proof, and it can be cleaned by just rinsing it with water. After shaving, just simply insert the head of the device, and it will clean automatically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you would like to really deep clean your M-9, use the cleaning brush provided with the package. Now, you are ready to keep your blades clean and sanitary, 24/7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike other ordinary nose hair trimmers that are just round in shape, the M-9 is round with straight and edged lines. These were done to provide a better grip with an ergonomic design. With this unique design, the M-9 will not roll over your countertop. (Or it can even be kept standing up)\n\n\n\n\n\nBy selecting non-glare black plastic, the M-9 has a modern and minimalistic look. The M-9 is the ultimately designed shaver for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Warning: When rinsing the device after disassembling the dome-head, be cautious as the blade might slip out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith our experience and technology in developing beauty appliances, we developed our own nose hair trimmer. We did not settle on just a single development, but we came up with a much safer and sanitary nose hair trimmer based on our customer's feedback and technological improvements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTR lifestyle.

It develops internally, and can be used on the go, wherever you are and whenever you like for creating and sharing real analogue prints!\n\n\n\nA photo taken with Pinsta onto Harman direct positive paper, exposure time 4 minutes\n\n\n\nMakes analogue photography available to everyone\nTransfer paper or negatives from your existing large format camera for on site developing\nLets you print analogue photos wherever you are and whenever you like\nBe sure that you have a good shot before you move on\nEnlarge your own 35mm, 6x45 and 6x6 negatives without the need for a darkroom\nLets you be creative like never before with Pinsta's internal slide system\nPreserve, engage in and show people the magic of analogue photography\nLearn more about traditional processes\nPerfect for education and photography workshops\nThoughtfully made Pinsta prints make wonderful presents for friends and family\n\n\n\u00a0Pinsta is also a mini-enlarger! For those already shooting film and wanting to get into analogue printing without the expense or need for a darkroom, Pinsta is here to help! Simply load your\u00a0negatives into the internal enlargement slide and you can enlarge them onto 4x5 inch paper. You can even create prints with fun and creative frames and overlays using Pinsta's ingenious internal slide system.\n\n\n\nA photo taken with Pinsta onto Harman direct positive paper. Exposure time 2.5 minutes\n\n\nAnyone can use Pinsta to produce photographic prints of their own, at home or out and about and without any further investment in darkroom equipment besides a dark bag for loading your next shot. Nothing beats the feeling of mounting your very own real photographic prints around your home.\n\n\n\nEnlarge your negatives to 4x5 using Pinsta\n\n\nThe sense of wonder you get upon revealing your first perfectly exposed photographic print can't be matched! You will learn from the prints you get wrong, and you will treasure the prints that you get right. This is raw photography, it's really good fun, it draws a crowd and it's a little bit of magic!\n\n\u00a0Find out what Mike Padua thinks of Pinsta Camera:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading paper, taking photos and developing your Prints:\n\n\n\nLoading your Pinsta camera couldn't be easier, simply put your camera and your photographic paper into the dark/changing bag to load a new piece of paper into the camera back. To take a shot simply position your camera and open the shutter. Typical exposure on a sunny day is 2 minutes.\n\n\n\nA photo taken with Pinsta onto Harman direct positive paper. Exposure time 3 minutes\n\n\nYour prints are developed with regular photographic chemistry and it is inserted and extracted with syringes. \u00a0When you are developing the camera body is your darkroom and your camera back becomes your developing tray!\n\n\n\nA clear demonstrational version of Pinsta shows how it develops prints internally\n\n\nDeveloping of black and white paper is a simple process so you can't really get it wrong. Develop for 1 minute, fix for 30 seconds to 4 minutes (depending on the paper) and add water to wash before revealing your amazing photographic print. A set of syringes will develop around 4-5 shots depending on which photographic paper you are using. The syringes are then replenished with your own chemistry once it is exhausted.\u00a0\n\nEnlarging negatives:\n\n\n\nEnlarging negatives with Pinsta is very much like taking a photo except that you position the negative inside the camera in-between the pinhole and the photographic paper using Pinsta's unique negative enlargement slide.\nYou then rotate the shutter disc to position the diffuser spot over the pinhole. Illuminating this spot with a bright light source transposes your negative onto the photographic paper inside. Your enlargement is then developed as if you had taken a photo.\u00a0\n\n\nUsing the Light Baffle/Filter slide to customize images:\nThe internal light baffle prevents light from bouncing off the camera walls and fogging your image but it can also be used as a filter slide and for customising your photos or enlargements with overlays, textures, double exposures or shaped exposures.. \u00a0There is a huge amount of creative potential with this slide.\u00a0\n\n\n\nUsing Pinsta's light baffle for filters and customised exposures\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomising the shape of your exposures with the light baffle/filter slide\n\n\n\nAvailable add-ons/accessories:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE, INTERCHANGEABLE PINHOLE SYSTEM NOW INCLUDED IN ALL KITS!\n\n\n\u00a330K - Laser cut Pinsta keyring: UNLOCKED!\nIf we reach \u00a330,000 we will include a Pinsta laser cut keyring with each Pinsta Kit\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a350K - Laser cut Pinsta keyring with print removal suction cup: \u00a0UNLOCKED!\nIf we reach \u00a350k then the keyring add on becomes a handy print removal tool! This makes removing your developed prints much easier!\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a3100K - 4x5 Magnetic frame included for each backer!\nIf we reach \u00a3100k we will include a free 4x5 Magnetic Display/Drying frame with each Pinsta Kit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a3200K - Pinsta community forum will be created:\nIf we reach \u00a3200k we will create an online forum for people to share their works, ideas and techniques. We expect many people will invent new ways of using Pinsta and we think a forum would be a nice melting pot for creators to get together. We may even hold annual awards events later on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a3N/A - Interchangeable pinhole system: NOW INCLUDED!\nat \u00a3300k we can add an interchangeable pinhole system, this will make Pinsta much more versatile going into the future. We believe we can vastly improve the enlarging quality of Pinsta if the Pinhole is modular and it will also enable us to potentially make larger backs for Pinsta such as 5x7 or 10x8 as Pinsta's current pinhole would be too small for these formats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a3500K - Company dedicated focus on Pinsta:\u00a0\n\u00a3500k would mean we can dedicate a large amount of our resources onto Pinsta and related upgrades in the future. We may even decide to focus the company on Pinsta entirely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have lots of plans for Pinsta and our hope is that it becomes a mainstay in the photography world. We see Pinsta not only as great fun for the hobbyist and an excellent tool for artistic creators but also as a brilliant learning tool. Our hope is that Pinsta cameras will be used all over the world in education and in recreational photography workshops alike.\u00a0\n\nFuture accessories for Pinsta might include:\n\n\nFilm backs for 35mm and 120\nWide angle back\nNarrow angle extension back\n10x8\" back\nDedicated phone app for automatic exposure calculation\n\n\nWe also expect that we can improve the enlarging sharpness of Pinsta in the future by offering a body extension section and a smaller pinhole.\n\n\n\nBrenda Stuart (one of our testers) using Pinsta at the playground @brendaclairestuart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPinsta kit with all accessories and add-ons\n\n\nI don't know about traditional processes and I'm a bit confused!? How exactly does it work?\nDon't worry, Pinsta couldn't be easier to use. We will be providing full detailed instructions in nice and easy to understand videos which start at the very basics of taking photos with Pinsta. Some of the more advanced features can then be learned over time which is what makes Pinsta a wonderful learning tool.\n\nHow does Pinsta achieve a positive image?\nPinsta can be used with HARMAN direct positive paper which is available in 4x5 size. Using this paper means that your prints come out positive with a normal develop and fix process. Magic!\n\nWhat do I need to use Pinsta?\nIn order to take photographs with Pinsta all you need is one of our kits and a film changing bag which are available as an add on. For paper and chemistry we recommend and have tested HARMAN 4x5 direct positive paper, ILFORD multigrade developer and ILFORD rapid fixer.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you wish to enlarge negatives with Pinsta you will also need the negative enlargement slide (available as an add on) and we recommend and have tested ILFORD 4x5 multigrade RC delux (negative) paper. In addition you will need a nice bright light source, almost any light source will do but we recommend something like an ultra bright LED torch that can be positioned closely to the diffuser spot as this will reduce exposure times. Ideally it should be plugged-in to the mains since this gives more consistent results than relying on battery power. Most rechargeable units can remain plugged in whilst in use.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nPaper and chemistry are available as a kit at a discounted price for Pinsta backers at www.firstcallphotographic.com. We will provide backers with a discount code once the campaign has ended.\u00a0\n\nCan I use different processes in Pinsta?\nYou can. Pinsta can be used however you want. If you have a different chemical process or medium you would like to use then Pinsta should be compatible with most things. Extra syringes are available if you have additional processes such as chemical reversal etc. We are very excited to see how people use Pinsta in different creative ways!\n\nHow does Pinsta extract chemistry through that hole?\nThe chemistry hole in the side of Pinsta leads to a tube which goes down to the tray. The chemistry is delivered and picked up right next to your photographic paper, it doesn't squirt in opposite the hole on the outer body..\n\nDo I have to keep buying chemistry syringes?\nNo you refill the syringes that come with the kit. This also saves on plastic waste associated with instant camera cartridge systems. They should last indefinitely and will be provided with coloured stickers so that you can identify which syringe is for which chemistry.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nIs there much cleaning in-between each use?\nThere is a little wiping required but not much. ABS is quite water repellent and most of the liquids are extracted by syringe. We recommend taking out a towel with you. A quick wipe of the bottom 20mm's of the camera body and the tray and it's ready to go again. Agitation is a gentle process and chemistry doesn't splash around inside if you are doing it correctly.\n\nCan I shoot film in Pinsta?\nYou can shoot 4x5 film no problems! It is possible for more advanced users to shoot 35mm or 120 film by cutting it and putting it into the internal enlargement slide. This would probably require a darkroom though as it would prove fiddly in a dark bag. We do plan to release film backs for Pinsta at a later date along with many other accessories and add-ons.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are typical Exposure times of Pinsta?\nPinsta is rated at F266 and Ilford direct positive paper is ISO 1-3. Typical exposure times are: Very sunny 1-2 minutes, Sunny 2-4 minutes, Sunny with clouds 4-12 minutes, Cloudy 12-30 minutes, Dull daylight conditions 40min-4hours. Indoor conditions can vary massively depending on lighting etc.\nEnlargement exposure times vary depending on your light source and the particular type of negatives you are using between 1 minute and 60 minutes. Black and white negative enlarge much faster than colour negatives.\n\nIs Pinsta expensive to use?\nThe cost of the chemistry will come in at pennies per shot. Ilford direct positive paper rrp is \u00a31 or $1.39 per sheet. Ilford Multigrade (negative) paper rrp is \u00a30.53p or $0.73 per sheet. Polariod 600's rrp by comparison is \u00a32.50 or $3.47 per shot and provides much smaller photos. (costs based on UK prices and may vary depending on your location/availability).\nPaper and chemistry are available as a kit at a discounted price for Pinsta backers at www.firstcallphotographic.com. We will provide backers with a discount code once the campaign has ended.\u00a0\n\n\n\nA photo taken with Pinsta onto Harman direct positive paper. Exposure time 2.5 minutes\n\n\nAre my negatives safe inside Pinsta?\nThe internal negative slide has been designed to protect your negatives from any splashing that may occur during the developing process. If you would prefer you can actually remove the negative slide from the camera using the dark bag after exposure and before developing. This means your negatives are not at any risk at all.\n\nHow good is the enlarging quality?\nThe enlarging quality from 120 negatives is surprisingly good considering that it is a lenseless system and certainly good enough for putting 4x5 pictures around your home, the larger the negatives the sharper the image for various reasons. The 35mm enlargements are a little softer and we recommend they are most useful for portraits and images that have less small details in them. Please see the examples section below for examples of each type of image.\n\n\n\n\n\nPinhole:\nPinholes have infinite focal length, so everything is in focus which is what makes many of the features of Pinsta possible. Pinsta camera includes a pinhole carefully selected at the right diameter (0.3mm's) and is manufactured using a special process called double etching, which ensures the absolute highest quality images possible are produced.\nThe quality of the pinhole is crucial to image quality. Professional quality double chemically etched pinholes aren't cheap and many other pinhole camera kits come with drilled or laser cut pinholes to save money.. Not Pinsta.\n\n\n\nPinsta's double chemically etched 0.3mm pinhole\n\n\n\nShutter:\nPinsta's shutter is different to any other camera on the market. It includes 3 photo settings for full frame and round and oval vignetted crop shots.\nThis rotates on a clicker which locks each setting into place. The lever allows you to switch to another setting quickly and easily.\nThe shutter disc also houses the white diffuser spot which is used for enlarging negatives. The diffuser spot is positioned over the pinhole and is illuminated using any external light source. This light passes through the negative and projects the negative \u00a0onto your photographic paper.\n\n\n\nPinsta's unique rotating shutter disc\n\n\n\nBody:\nThe Pinsta body is made from thick 'pinseal' ABS and has a nice weight and high quality feel to it with landscape and portrait bubble levels. It has a number of cool features, the most significant of which is the ability to add and extract chemistry through a special light tight cavity using syringes. This means when developing your images your camera body is actually also your darkroom.\u00a0\nThe body also includes 2 tripod mounts for portrait and landscape shots, 2 bubble levels and gun sights to ensure you're getting the correct framing.\n\n\n\nPinsta camera body\n\n\n\n\nCamera Back/Tray:\nThe back of your camera is also your developing tray. It includes magnets which fix it to the camera body and ensure perfect light tightness. This accommodates 4x5 inch photo paper or film. The photographic paper is sandwiched between the camera back and the camera body which holds it flat and in place when shooting and developing. The paper also acts as a gasket which prevents the chemistry from leaking.\n\n\n\nMagnetic camera Back/Tray\n\n\n\nEnlargement Slide: (available as an add-on)\nThe enlargement slide can accommodate 35mm, 645, 6x6 and 6x7 negatives (6x7 size will be cropped to 6x6). There are different mounting positions inside the camera body depending on which negative size you are using.\nThe possibilities are quite literally endless with the internal slide system and we're really excited to see what our backers do with this innovation. Advanced users can even shoot film using these slides, or double expose a new shot with an existing negative..\n\n\n\nPinsta's unique internal enlargement slide\n\n\n\nInternal Light Baffle/Filter Slide: (included in all kits)\nThe internal light baffle/filter slide is similar to the enlargement slide but it is used to prevent unwanted light from bouncing around inside the camera and fogging your prints. This is one of the reasons that Pinsta gives excellent image quality.\nThis slide can also be used for attaching filters or for customising your images with custom shaped exposures when you are shooting or enlarging. It is designed to be left in the camera at all times when shooting in the slide position closest to the pinhole.\u00a0\n\n\n\nInternal light baffle/filter slide\n\n\n\nDark Bag: (available as an add-on)\nThe dark bag is a light tight bag used to load your next shot into the camera. It keeps your paper or film from being exposed to light during its journey between the paper box and the camera. Our dark bags are bigger than some others on the market which makes loading your Pinsta camera a little easier.\u00a0\n\n\n\nChanging bag\n\n\nDrying/Display Frames: (available as an add-on)\nOur magnetized drying frames are used for keeping your print relatively flat whilst it dries. Fiber based papers can bend quite a lot whilst drying so if you intend to shoot mostly fiber based papers such as Harman direct positive paper then we suggest adding on a few drying frames. These ensure that your prints dry evenly and remain flat whilst they dry.\nThese frames can also be used to display your photographs around the house and are great for displaying your work as fridge magnets!\n\n\n\n4x5 display/drying frame\n\n\n\nContact Plate/Print Press: (available as an add-on)\nMore advanced users may like our magnetized contact plate add on. The contact plate means that you can produce 'false' positive images using negative paper.\u00a0\nThis plate produces a perfect positive replica of your negative by sandwiching it with a fresh piece of negative paper and then exposing it to light. You can then transfer the exposed false positive to your Pinsta inside a dark bag for developing as normal.\nIt can also be used as a print press! Leave them in here for a day or two and they'll be perfectly flat.\n\n\n\nContact plate/print press\n\n\nSyringe:\nEach kit comes with 3 or more syringes, these syringes are used for inserting and extracting your chemistry. They come with coloured stickers for identifying which syringe is for which chemistry. Additional syringes are available as an add-on.\n\n\n\nSyringes are inserted into a small hole in the side of Pinsta to insert and extract chemistry\n\n\n\nSyringe Dock: (available as an add-on)\nThe syringe dock is used to store your syringes. This keeps them safe and secure during transit and also makes them easier to organize when developing prints. The syringe dock also has a handy strap mount so they can be mounted onto the strap of your camera bag\n\n\n\nSyringe dock\n\n\n\nBottle Kit: (available as an add-on)\nThe bottle kit includes 3 chemistry bottles and one larger dump bottle. \u00a0The bottles have sealed lids. These come in very useful especially if you plan on taking lots of photos whilst you're out or are going on a longer excursion. The larger tops allow easy access for your syringes.\nYou must always dispose of your exhausted chemistry in a responsible manner so even if you don't add our bottle kit you will need to carry storage for your spent chemistry.\n\n\n\nBottle kit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some examples of photos and enlargements made with Pinsta Camera.\u00a0\n\n\n\nPhotos taken with Pinsta\n\n\n\n\n\nZoomed examples of above photos\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft: Enlarged 35mm negative. Right: enlarged 645 (120) negative\n\n\n\n\n\nZoomed examples of above enlargements\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto taken with Pinsta of Nikon F Photomic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnlargement made from 645 negative\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind more images and video examples on our instagram page:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy name is Oliver, I am 35 years old and have been a keen photographer and inventor my life so far, taking after my Dad Harry New who invented the Nova Vertical slot print processor back in the 1980's.\n\n\n\nMy father and my brother Matthew recently designed a brand new combined processor and washer darkroom system called Optima which we successfully launched on kickstarter in 2019\n\n\nSitting on a stool next to my dad in his darkroom is one of my most distinct memories as a small child. The combination of sounds, smells and the wonder of watching images illuminated by the red glow of the safelight magically appear in front of my eyes is something I will never forget. He would often shoot weddings and show jumping events and would occasionally let me sit in on his darkroom sessions.\n\n\n\nA photo of me taken with Pinsta onto negative paper and inverted digitaly. Exposure time 1 minute 15 seconds\n\n\nMy first proper camera was a Pentax ME and I had a fascination with long exposures and used to go into the garden at night experimenting, setting my camera up with a fixed open shutter and shining my torch on the plants and trees. I'd take the film up to the local photography shop to have it developed for collection the next day. The anticipation all part of the enjoyment of the process. Something lost with the instant gratification lifestyles we all live in now..\n\n\n\nPinhole cameras we already produce at our factory\n\n\nYears on and in a small factory in rural Warwickshire our family company had been hand making pinhole cameras for one of the biggest names in the industry when one day it occurred to me that there was an opportunity for us to produce something more accessible to people without a darkroom. Something that could hopefully introduce new people into the magic of traditional photography, and to help advanced photographers learn even more about the origins their trade. From this idea Pinsta was born...\n\n\nThe development of Pinsta:\n\n\n\nJust some of the different Pinsta prototypes we have produced\n\n\nProduct prototyping is one of the things our company does, which is fortunate as it has saved us a lot of costs which we can actually pass on to you! Overall we've spent around a year developing Pinsta to the complete product it is now.\u00a0\n\n\n\nParts drawing for Pinsta components\n\n\nWe have produced around 15 different designs of various types. Continual improvements have been made to the designs of the shutter disc, chemistry/ventilation system, sights, pinhole, tray/back and internal slide system.\n\n\n\nPrototypes in production. Much more sophisticated jigs will be produced for large scale production. If Pinsta does well enough the main body and tray/back will be injection moulded.\n\n\nPinsta at the Photography Show:\nWe thoroughly enjoyed exhibiting at the photography show and received nothing but amazing comments and feedback on Pinsta. We felt it was important to show that Pinsta was a serious and fully developed product and what better way to do this than demonstrate it to thousands of people at the show. I did many demonstrations and interviews for various magazines and publications.\u00a0\nThankyou to everyone who showed up and gave their support, some people even came just to see Pinsta!\n\nAmateur Photographer Magazine recorded this live negative enlargement demonstration for their social media platforms (poor sound):\n\n\n\n\u00a0Sunny 16 Podcast also popped over and made a video and we should be featuring on their podcast soon:\n\n\n\n\u00a0Jon Bentley from the Gadget show even paid a visit:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no doubt that photography in all its forms can have a huge impact on mental health. The combination of elements that involve the process make it an inherently therapeutic pass time. Getting out somewhere you might not otherwise go, meeting people, engaging in an art form, joining a community, the enjoyment of taking beautiful images and the continual pursuit of learning (because there is always more to learn) are just some of the reasons why photography brings so many people so much happiness.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe believe that analogue photography in particular encourages a state of mindfulness and the slower processes are in themselves a meditation. In a world where everything is fast and on demand it's a wonderful liberation to rediscover the joy of taking your time and enjoying a real tactile and thought provoking process.\n\n\n\nA big thankyou:\n\nLastly I'd like to give a big thankyou to Mark Anthony Galluzzo and his company Mabinogi who not only produced our campaign video for us but did a great deal of testing with Pinsta. We couldn't have been more happy with them and the genuinely personal service that they provided.\nhttps://www.mabinogi.co.uk/crowdfunding/\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0If you would like further updates on new Pinsta products/accessories after the campaign then please join our mailing list at www.pinstacamera.com"

        "Text": "\n\n\n\n\nEver tried to carry a big heavy combo amp to a gig, and then transport it back home at 1 am, all in an effort to impress the audience with a great sound?\nDid you buy countless expensive pedals, because you cannot play a gig with the amp giving you just one sound?\nEver tried to achieve a perfect sound with a modeling amp, but can never shake the feeling that it could be better if you maybe just spent a few more days tweaking the sound?\n\nWe tried all of that.\n\nAll of the hardship of those problems manifested into creating a truly unique solution, a guitar amp that is light and versatile, and sounds incredible with every setting you have it set to.\nYou no longer need to make a choice between the quality, warmth, and ease of use of a tube amplifier and the versatility and lightness of modern guitar systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmonito is a guitar amplification system that brings together boutique guitar effects, an incredible sounding tube analog circuit, instant switching between presets, and a quality loud sound monitoring system all in one extremely light package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree main segments are responsible for Amonito sounding as good as it does.\n\nSymbiosis of the switchable high voltage analog TUBE circuit and digital signal processing\nCustom user interface that offers versatility and programmability without the need to read the manual\nA new concept of guitar speaker cabinet placement\n\nEach of these is a novelty on the guitar amp market, but together they make for one of the most incredible pieces of guitar gear that the world has ever seen.\n\n\n\n\n\nSYMBIOSIS OF THE SWITCHABLE HIGH VOLTAGE ANALOG TUBE CIRCUIT AND DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING\nAt the heart of Amonito is the main analog compact circuit, that responds and sounds like a full tube amp. A combination of two vacuum tubes, 12AX7 and 12AU7, and MOSFETS are all running on high voltage to give the guitarist ultimate dynamic range and feel that no digital processing could accomplish. Dozens of strategically placed little electronic switches make this one of the most versatile tube circuits on the market today.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd because almost every player needs effects like reverb, chorus, delay, and others, we added a special chip - one of the most powerful SHARC\u00ae DSPs that is responsible for all of the effects that complete the sound coming out of the analog circuit.\nWe could have stopped there, but there was one thing bothering us.\nWhat many guitarists that have played tube amps know is that they don\u2019t sound amazing on just any setting - they have a sweet spot. A certain setting that sounds the best, but this makes the amp less versatile and you can\u2019t always have it as loud as necessary to get to it.\nAnd since we have that SHARC\u00ae power, we put the DSP before and after the analog circuit!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is how we achieved total control of the sound and made one sweet spot a thing of the past! The amp has now become interconnected with thousands of parameters, many of them helping to prepare the sound for its journey in the high voltage analog world, and the rest applying finishing touches after it transitions back into the digital. No other analog amp has ever had such flexibility!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCUSTOM USER INTERFACE THAT OFFERS VERSATILITY AND PROGRAMMABILITY WITHOUT READING THE MANUAL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlaying and creating music is a deeply intimate process and with our product, we want the guitarists to spend their time in the creative zone and to enjoy the experience instead of tweaking every single parameter while reading the manual.\nTo address this, instead of offering an off-the-shelf\u00a0LCD and a thick manual on how to use it, we designed custom touchscreen displays like you haven\u2019t seen before. There are no pixels, it feels and looks analog.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach knob on these displays is smartly connected to many parameters and intertwined with other knobs so that you get a beautifully simple experience while the system in the background does all the hard work to keep the sound great no matter what you do.\n\n\n\n\n\nCombined with extremely reliable optical footswitches, to which the user can assign their own personal settings, you are now in instant control of not just the effects, but also the whole analog tube amp structure, with just a push of a single button.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmonito features a wireless access point, so when we upgrade the software, you would just have to use the app to upload the latest release. No need for a cable, all of the software updates will be available wirelessly through the app, so uploading the latest released firmware on Amonito will be made as simple as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA NEW CONCEPT OF GUITAR SPEAKER CABINET PLACEMENT\nTo make it as light and sturdy as possible, we moved away from wood for the construction material and chose - aluminum for the more affordable Classic version and carbon fiber for the premium, Carbon version.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a ported design to give you a deep, full sound, and a power amplifier that delivers 200W RMS this cabinet is truly something different. The sound of a high-quality 8\u201d neodymium speaker is being further enhanced by our processing and is firing into a specially constructed wave deflector to give you a smooth top end and wide coverage with high frequencies. It doesn\u2019t sound like a guitar speaker, but like a guitar speaker that has been professionally miked up in the studio, and with different amps you also hear different speakers! You haven\u2019t heard an 8\u201d speaker that sounds like this.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut we went one step further!\u00a0\nWe completely changed the way you hear this speaker system on stage and moved it from the usual position in the back to the front where the guitarist can hear it much better. This way the sound spill from the stage is greatly reduced - sound guys will absolutely love it! And with dedicated XLR outputs for the PA, it means that the audience will get to enjoy great sound too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe paired Amonito with some of the most popular electric guitars, played by guitarists with their unique style. While many modern amplifiers sound similar with different guitars and players, Amonito really lets the character of the guitar and guitarist's technique shine through.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndy Cortes\nAndy is a London-based guitar player influenced by Eric Clapton, Albert Collins, and other guitar legends. Andy has toured with James Bay for many years and has also played with one of the blues greats, Buddy Guy.\u00a0\nHe was a founding member of the band Cortes and is now also creating his original work under his name, Andy Cortes.\n\n\n\nOz Marshall (YT Channel: Guitar Safari)\nOz has played with members of Judas Priest, Alice Cooper, Cradle of Filth, and has Manowar guitarist David Snake, as well as many others, guesting on the new CD of his band Snake Eyes.\n \u00a0\u00a0He also has a YouTube channel \"Guitar Safari\" where he does gear reviews.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth of our products feature the same analog tube circuit, the same amplifier and speaker, and the same user interface. But, there are differences between them that make the Carbon version a more premium model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth versions of Amonito offer the same functionality, which is comprised of 5 main stages:\n\nPre Effects\nAmplifier\nEqualization\nPost Effects\nPower and mute\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre Effects section\nThe PRE section includes guitar effects that are used in front of an amplifier by most guitarists. Just like normal pedals, these effects have a lot of control, but most of it is hidden away in our smart processing. Only one of these effects can be on at the same time.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmplifier section\nThere are four types of amplifiers to choose from, two base models and two variants of them. Each one has a different sound and feel, thanks to the extensive physical switching of the analog circuit.\n\n\n\n\n\nEqualization section\nEveryone is probably familiar with EQ settings, but while simple to use, on Amonito, these are much more powerful than it seems at first glance.\nWith the help of smart processing, the whole amplifier is reacting to these settings so that is not simply an EQ after the amplifier section, but it is modifying the signal so that you \u201cget what you wish for\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if you would like to have the sound from a bright clean vintage amplifier (assuming a vintage clean model is selected on the AMP section), simply increase the treble and possibly reduce the bass and the whole amp will shift around these parameters to provide you with a sound that would be produced by a typical bright vintage tube amp. Even effects before the amplifier will adjust to these settings.\n\nPost Effects section\n(Almost) no guitar sound is perfect without some kind of reverb, delay, or other modulation effects - or even all together.\n\n\n\n\n\nPower and mute\nThe last thing every amplifier needs is a way to turn it on and off and to be able to mute all of the outputs with just one button. Both of these have been incorporated into our displays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmonito offers all the main connections you need in a live or a studio environment.\u00a0\nFirst, the signal is received by a high impedance FET input that preserves its original clarity and definition and is sent to the rest of the circuitry via a low noise balanced connection.\nSince many guitarists will never part with their own choice of pedals and effects, Amonito offers a send/return loop that is positioned after the analog tube circuit and can be switched on or off via a button on the displays. This allows the user to turn the send/return loop on or off using the footswitches on Amonito.\nSince the built-in speaker is intended to be used as a personal stage guitar monitoring system, Amonito features two other main outputs to be used either in the studio or in a live performance. Line outputs are carrying a raw signal, that can either be processed by software plugins in a studio environment or plugged into another power amp on stage. The XLR outputs carry a signal that has been optimized for live, PA applications. A high-quality IR cabinet simulation makes sure that even the most nit-picking live sound technicians will be satisfied with the sound. And of course, these outputs can be used in a studio recording for a very quick and effortless setup.\nAmonito Carbon comes with stereo Send/return, line, and XLR output connections, while ALL the connections on Amonito Classic are mono.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe believe that a high-quality product such as Amonito should never be carried around without protection. Therefore, we will be shipping every product with a corresponding padded bag.\nCurrently, we only have one prototype for the bag ready, and it will take some trial and error to get it just the way we want it. But, we can tell you that the final bag will be light, padded on all sides, and equipped with a carrying handle and backpack straps! This way, you will be able to easily take Amonito everywhere you go and will not have to worry about damaging the surface or hardware.\nFor even more reliable transportation, we will be offering a hard case made from fiberglass. It will be available for purchase as an add-on, but later on, once the project has been successfully funded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are Marko and Andra\u017e and we come from Slovenia, Europe. Both electrical engineers and both musicians. Our journey of building guitar amplifiers began about 6 years ago when we decided to build our first unique tube amp. Since then we have designed and built many guitar amplifiers, bass and guitar effects, and other audio products. During this time we were actively involved in our bands, playing all sorts of big and small venues, meeting all sorts of musicians, especially guitarists, and getting to know their musical styles, habits, problems, and wishes. We discovered that a lot of them were unhappy with their gear, may it be the weight, sound, limitations, and even complexity of the modern guitar equipment.\nThat's where the idea of creating our innovative guitar amplifier came in.\nWe discovered that with our knowledge of electrical engineering, programming, and amp building we could make a difference by providing guitarists with an amplifier that sounds just as good as the old tube amps, but is extremely lighter, includes all the must-have modern effects, offers the choice of completely restructuring the analog tube circuit with a flick of a preset switch, but still remains as easy and intuitive to use as the old amps were. No more back hurting at 3 AM after a concert. No more confusing connections between pieces of gear. No more spending weeks or even months in your studio, trying to find that perfect sound. Just lighter, smarter, and intuitive. The vision for the AMONITO guitar amplifier was born.\nAfter more than a year of prototyping and validating the concept of innovative weight reduction techniques we pitched this idea to the start-up incentive program P2 at the Slovene enterprise fund and got the grant. This enabled us to assemble a small team and continue working on the project. Since then it has almost been two years, and during this time the whole team worked very hard to make this project a reality.\nWe can't tell you how excited we are to finally be able to offer Amonito to guitarists all over the world!\nMarko and Andra\u017e, founders and lead developers of the AMONITO guitar amplifier\n\nLearn more about us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "Text": "From 2018 to 2020, we took Kickstarter by storm with the Fingertip Microscopes - iMicro Q, iMicro C, and iMicro Q2, earning 20K pledges from the community over 40K iMicros delivered to our backers in over 70 countries. It is a breakthrough in portable microscopy - we're pretty proud, and thank you all for your support.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe keep improving and polishing the iMicros, and we never stop - now we've taken our effort one step further and are pleased to bring you the new fingertip microscope - iMicro Q2p, the first smartphone microscope with polarizing function.\nWhat is Fingertip Microscope (iMicro Q2p)?\nSince Antony van Leeuwenhoek invented his microscope in the 17th century, microscope technology has progressed tremendously. Microscopes with excellent performance are usually bulky, heavy, and expensive, even for portable ones. With our years of effort, what we introduced in 2018 - the fingertip microscope iMicro Q - is a real breakthrough in mobile microscopy. It has comparable optical performance to a professional desktop microscope and enables you to carry it with you as easily as you bring your phone. In addition to the iMicro Q's excellent optical performance and portability, we launched iMicro Q2 in 2020 with enhanced compatibility to work with any smartphone.\nPolarized light is a contrast-enhancing technique that improves the quality of the image obtained with birefringent materials, such as crystals, minerals, liquid crystals, and plastics. The polarized light microscope (polarizing microscope) is designed to observe and photograph specimens primarily due to its optically anisotropic character. Usually, a polarized light microscope is much more expensive and only available for professionals. Now with iMicro Q2p, in addition to the function of a typical biology microscope, we bring you this tiny Fingertip Microscope with the fantastic polarizing function.\n\n\n\n\n\nHighlights\n\nThe first smartphone polarizing microscope\nImproved focusing control with the focusing stand\nVery high magnification power: up to 800x\nVery high resolution power: Down to 1 micron\nVery low distortion: Comparable to a desktop microscope\nShallow profile and weight: \u00bd inch and ~1/60 oz\nExtremely easy to carry: fit in wallet like a card\nMeager cost: ~1% of the price of a desktop microscope\nCompatible with any smartphone\n\n\nHere are some micrographs took with iMicro Q2p (using an iPhone 11):\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are more example micrographs with polarizers and without polarizers - solid proof that the polarizing function dramatically enhanced the contrast with rich colors.\n\n\n\n\n\nKey features of iMicro Q2p\n\nThe first smartphone polarizing microscope\n\nTo our knowledge, iMicro Q2p is the first smartphone microscope with the polarizing function integrated with such a small profile. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Improved focusing control with the focusing stand\u00a0\n\nOur previous backers queried a lot on a focusing stand/support to the fingertip microscopes. We listen to our backers, and we have worked hard on designing a convenient, flexible, intuitive stand to allow precision focusing. Finally, we have a satisfactory solution. \u00a0It works very well and is also simple to use.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtremely high magnification:\u00a0up to 800x\n\nIt has the same high magnification as iMicro Q and Q2. Here are the micrographs of the fiber from one dental floss. If you don't have a microscope, you don't know it has such a fine structure on this fiber. It is amazing!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVery high resolution\n\nResolution is more important than magnification when speaking about the performance of a microscope. The USAF 1951 resolution test chart was used to test the resolution of iMicro Q2p on an iPhone 11. The intervals between the finest test bars are 2.19 micrometers. The finest test bars on the 7th group are clearly seen, indicating its resolution is far beyond that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVery low distortion\n\nWe used a grid calibration target to test the distortion. Even in full view at the edge of the visual field, no noticeable distortion was observed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtremely low profile\n\nIt is about the size of a fingertip and weighs only 0.5g (~1/60 oz). It is very thin, only 3.2mm (1/8 inch). No parts extrude beyond the edge of your phone when it is installed. Also, the focusing stand has not increased the profile regarding the whole pack - still in the card size and easily fit in a wallet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAffordable to every budget\n\nWe are very proud of the Fingertip Microscope and would like everyone to be able to afford it. With a polarizing function, we can still keep it at a low cost. With the money you would need to buy a traditional desktop microscope, you could purchase many Fingertip Microscopes, making this a great option for children and students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorks with any smartphone\n\nAs iMicro Q2 lens and iMicro C lens, we design iMicro Q2p in a tiny round style to fit any phone with a camera. They will be coupled to your smartphone by an innovative, re-useable, nano-suction pad. Whether your phone has a single back camera or multiple back cameras, a flat camera(s), or extruded camera(s), these tiny round lenses will fit well with them.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinciple and development process\n\nThe magnification\n\nThe magnification mainly relies on its complex optical system for traditional compound microscopes, including objective and eyepiece. Its total magnification is a combination of the magnification of objective and eyepiece.\nFor our fingertip microscope, three stages of magnification are combined to achieve the total magnification. First, the lens provides optical magnification to generate the image on the smartphone camera's sensor; second, the image on the sensor is displayed on the much larger screen via the electronic process and magnification; third, digital zoom provides further magnification as a digital magnification to the image. The total magnification is a combination of these three.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe traditional polarizing microscope has a complex structure. Especially a polarizer and another polarizer (analyzer) are added before and after the specimen in the optical system. For iMicro Q2p, we mimic this polarizing structure but keep it in a small profile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment path and process\n\nWe have walked a long way to develop these smartphone-based microscopic tools since registering the first patent in 2012. We have already successfully built a series of smartphone microscope products, including iMICROSCOPE, iMICROSCOPE R, and the \u03bcRuler, iMicro Q, iMicro C, iMicro Q2, as well as this new version iMicro Q2p.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have shaped and polished our Fingertip Microscope idea according to previous backers' and customers' suggestions and comments based on our previous successful projects. We have optimized the optics and the overall design, and each step was tested and refined using prototypes to achieve the best performance possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure detail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe essential techniques\u00a0\n\nStress-free multi-element aspherical micro-lens with polarizer integrated\n\nThe lens is a crucial component of the system. A small ball lens (van Leeuwenhoek) is a straightforward approach. But it is well known to suffer from a very limited usable field of view due to severe field curvature effects, spherical and other aberrations. The iMicro Q2p uses a more complex multi-aspherical lens design and integrated polarizer to achieve high magnification performance and low aberration with polarizing function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInnovative illumination: Reflection/transmission lighting with polarizer\n\nIn iMicro Q2p, we incorporated a new reflection/polarizing/transmission lighting. The thin PP case is not only used to pack and protect the product but also used as a light-reflective illumination box. The light from the flashlight and ambient light goes to the bottom of the lighting box and is reflected from the thin PP case's bottom wall to illuminate the sample after being polarized.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Seamless coupling with the smartphone: Nano-suction pad attachment\u00a0\n\nUnlike conventional adhesive, the nano suction pad mimics gecko's footpads: it has thousands of micro air pockets functioning like micro-suction cups to hold the device to the phone.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery on and off application will leave nothing on the phone. This newly developed \"nano suction pad\" is residue-free, non-tacky, and repeatable. The use of a nano suction pad has been proved in our previous product, and it is repeatable and easily cleaned by a PSA tape (such as Scotch tape).\n\nEasy focus with focusing stand\n\nWe believe you will like this focusing stand - it works very well and keeps a low profile. It is made of engineering plastic (PMMA, acrylic resin) and is strong enough with durability. It is also very simple and easy to set up to use. After using it, you can disassembly it and store it in the thin PP case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03bcRuler and Dedicated App: for professional needs\n\nA high-quality \u03bcRuler M (stage micrometer) will be provided with iMicro Q2p to calibrate the scale-bar in our App, i-Seeing, and enable you to measure size accurately. Please see our previous campaign, \u03bcRuler- A micro-ruler to measure micro-objects, for more information. \u03bcRuler Q will be available as an add-on.\n\n\n\n\n\niMicro Q2p actually works with any camera App which can control the flashlight when shooting or you provide illumination with an extra torch. In some cases, it is crucial to have a scale-bar and ensure its accuracy on the micrograph. The dedicated App, i-Seeing, was designed to take micrographs to meet professional demand. The scale-bar on the micrograph can be toggled on/off to enable you to embed a scale-bar on the image if required.\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison of iMicro Q2, \u00a0C, and Q2p\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat people say about Fingertip Microscope\n\n\n\n\n\nApplication\nIt is super portable, and you don't need complicated settings, so you can immediately take images, use them for reporting and transferring images to your colleagues. Plus, you can use it with any smartphone. It can be used in many professions where you need accurate images and easily accessible research photographs in the field.\u00a0\nMany of our previous backers shared their application with beautiful and unique pictures when using the fingertip microscopes. Here are a few examples. Many of them are from our previous backers' photos with the iMicro Q2 and iMicro C on their phones; Some of them are our test photos for the polarizing function. With the polarizing function, you will have more power for its application.\n\n\n\n\n\nHighlights\n\n\n\n\n\nRewards\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 2,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $900M raised between them."

Tony describes himself as a \"reformed\" lawyer who has spent the last decade of his professional life leading healthcare, wellness, and technology companies. Alissa has spent her entire career in digital media and television production. She also has two Emmys for her work sitting on the couple's mantle (Tony has no Emmys, but Alissa let him hold them once). Together, while working our separate day jobs and raising our three young children, we run BLOK from our home in the suburbs just outside of Philadelphia.\nWe spent a lot of time this past year cooking together at home. We quickly realized there were no fun and contemporary cooking classes that we could realistically stream with our family members in different locations throughout the country.\nThat\u2019s when the idea for BLOK was born! We put pen to paper and started working on developing BLOK. We came up with an attractive custom-designed piece of hardware that creates a virtual experience for friends and family where they can learn to prepare delicious and healthy meals in a fun and engaging way. BLOK is so much more than a smart cutting board, it\u2019s a community of foodies all over the world!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs one of the first crowdfunding marketing agencies,\u00a0Enventys Partners\u00a0has brought more than 750 crowdfunding projects to life through lead generation, campaign page creation, public relations, email marketing, Facebook Advertising, campaign management and more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWireframe for our future app\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBLOK\u2019s founding principle is to cultivate a community in the kitchen-- to provide consumers access to real, relatable chefs while cooking delicious meals with friends and family. Without that community, and passionate, inspiring chefs, BLOK wouldn\u2019t exist\u2014 and that\u2019s why BLOK is committed to giving back. If BLOK reaches its Kickstarter funding goal, co-founders Tony and Alissa will make a personal donation of $2,000 to Careers through Culinary Arts Program. C-CAP is a workforce development nonprofit that provides underserved teens a pathway to success in the culinary arts in Philadelphia and across the country. As the BLOK community grows, Tony and Alissa look forward to growing their support for C-CAP. For more information about C-CAP, visit: ccapinc.org\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can\u2019t thank you enough for checking out our project and helping us make BLOK a reality.\nWe know not everyone will be able to support us with a pledge, so even if you can\u2019t give a dollar or pre-order a BLOK, if you\u2019re a supporter of BLOK, you can help us spread the word on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Instagram and anywhere else you can think of!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Because of the short brewing time, you can enjoy the very fresh taste of the coffee while the sonic waves extract the pure essence of the coffee, creating great tasting cold brew coffee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWaiting 10 hours for cold brew coffee is simply inefficient! \u00a0After that long wait time, you\u2019re left with very little coffee. Worse yet, it doesn\u2019t taste as good as it could. \u00a0The long steeping time invites taste-altering bacteria and germs. \u00a0Three wrongs simply don\u2019t make a right.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the Super Sonic H, you can taste the difference in a fraction of the time! Our revolutionary sonic sound wave technology allows to make cold brew coffee in as little as 5 minutes. This means you get much more great tasting cold brew coffee in less than a fraction of the time.\nWhat is more, the low acidity, cleaner taste produced by the innovative Sonic Dutch\u2019s built-in sound wave system will surely bring a smile to your face!\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2020, we launched a Kickstarter campaign for our original machine the Super Sonic S1. It was a great success, and we have received many positive responses from our backers, which also include very helpful ideas and suggestions for future product development.\nUsing what we learned from our backers, we felt it was time for the next evolution. \u00a0We are proud to introduce The Super Sonic H. \u00a0It\u2019s lighter, stronger (with the use of dual magnets) and more compact.\nYou can make amazing cold brew coffee in your home, office, or hotel room in just moments! Amazing cold brew coffee shouldn\u2019t have to be a long and complicated process.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith our innovative sonic wave technology, you\u2019ll be enjoying the great tasting, low caffeine cold brew coffee in about five minutes! Best of all with our system, it\u2019s tastier and healthier than the conventional way of making it.\u00a0\nAlso, Super Sonic H has a built-in Bluetooth speaker that you can pair your favorite music or podcast with your beverage! \u00a0\nIn short, The Super Sonic H Cold Brew Coffee maker is the next evolution of cold brew coffee making, something we consider to be hybrid coffee.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0The \u201cmagic\u201d behind the Super Sonic H is the sonic sound wave technology. \u00a0This revolutionary innovation was created by Sonic Dutch Korea.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike traditional methods, this technique uses sound waves generated and the onboard magnetic circuits to create waves that mix the coffee as it\u2019s being prepared. This combination of waves and vertical vibration create the perfect marriage to function and technique to create a quick and hygienic brewing process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimple. The longer the coffee sits, the more exposure to harmful bacteria may arise. This not only alters the taste, but may also cause hygienic problems! The quick and short extraction time of Super Sonic H eliminates possible exposure to harmful bacteria. What is more, the sonic wave cold brewing creates the perfect balance of caffeine and flavor. This ensures that every glass of cold brew coffee will taste as great as the last.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany have asked. How can you extract coffee in such a short time? Does it really taste like coffee? Well, the answer is yes! And what is more, the taste is even fresher, richer and more flavorful. That's not all. With Super Sonic H, you can customize the taste by controlling the extraction time up to 30 minutes!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe undertook an experiment to measure the density of cold brew coffee produced by traditional cold brew extraction methods and Super Sonic H. \u00a0Results showed cold brewing for 5 minutes by Sonic Dutch is as dense as the results brewed for 10 hours by the conventional methods, and the coffee concentration increases even more as we increased the extraction time on Super Sonic H as shown above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the key things that sets Super Sonic H apart is the lower caffeine. It has less caffeine than traditional espresso and conventional cold brew coffee. \u00a0\nHowever, we understand that not everyone wants a lower amount of caffeine in their coffee all the time. \u00a0So with that, you are able to customize the level of caffeine by increasing the time setting on Super Sonic H, while still maintaining the refreshing taste of your coffee. \u00a0For the maximum amount of caffeine, you would simply need to have the Super Sonic H run for a longer cycle up to 30 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe requested the Korea Advanced Food Research Institute, the civil agency that inspects food, packing materials, herbal medicinal ingredients, and drinking water-related goods. The results were amazing!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the report, \u00a0Super Sonic Cold Brew Coffee has much less amount of caffeine compared to other kinds of coffee including filtered and espresso coffee. While some of you prefer to have a certain amount of caffeine in your coffee, excessive caffeine is certainly not good for your health. Super Sonic H offers a way healthier coffee for you!\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the built-in Bluetooth speaker, you\u2019re able to create a cafe experience in your own home! Pair the speaker with your mobile device. \u00a0Listen to your favorite tunes while you are brewing up your favorite coffee!\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe designed the Super Sonic H to be sleek, futuristic and elegant. \u00a0It will be at home on any modern countertop. \u00a0The simple design includes a fold-out handle for easy transport. It also boasts a built-in Bluetooth speaker, three-button operation(One for Bluetooth, one for the timer and a start and stop button).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Super Sonic H is currently being used in more than 1000 cafes in South Korea! So what do professional coffee makers think of our unique cold brew coffee making technique? The taste reviews are in: They love it!\nHere is how an experienced barista described the coffee brewed by Super Sonic H, our previous product which essentially uses the same sonic wave technology:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0They found it to be \u201cVery rich (in taste)\u201d while \u201cNot compromising the inherent flavor of the coffee\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother great thing about the Super Sonic is that it\u2019s easy to use! \u00a0Too often people stay away from making their own cold brew coffee because it seems too complicated.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0We\u2019ve been talking a lot about making cold brew coffee. \u00a0But that isn\u2019t the only use for the Super Sonic H!\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0This is a great device for wine lovers as well! What do we mean? Glad you asked! Using our Sound Wave technology the Supersonic can enrich the taste of your favorite wine by decanting the wine. \u00a0If listening to music on vinyl is how music should sound, then drinking freshly decanted wine is how wine should taste! The Super Sonic H unlocks that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0It\u2019s no secret that tea is one of the most popular drinks in the world. \u00a0With the SuperSonic H, you can enjoy perfectly made cold brew tea or milk tea in less than five minutes. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Tea Making\n\n\n\n\n\nMilk Tea Making\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0The device comes in either black or white. \u00a0With the outline of the speaker available in classic chrome, or elegant rose gold. \u00a0The internal LED light is available in either white or orange.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Every story has a beginning. \u00a0The Story of the Sonic Dutch began with three coffee lovers sitting in their favorite cafe. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAs they often did, (Sonic Dutch\u2019s soon to be CEO)Lee Sangjoon, (Sonic Dutch\u2019s soon to be \u00a0head of mechanical design and product development)Meoungha Ji & (Sonic Dutch\u2019s soon to be electronic circuit development) Taeyang Hwang discussed many things. With the most common topic of conversation being their favorite beverage: coffee. They loved cold brew coffee.\n\nBut much like the visionary Steve Jobs did when looking at archaic mobile phones, they knew where there was room to improve and innovate. \u00a0So a question was raised by a barista who posed us with a question: \u201cwhat if we put cold water in a tumbler and used motion to extract the coffee?\u201d This was the spark that would become the raging inferno of an idea. \u00a0\u00a0This was the birth of the idea for Sonic Wave Technology. Millions of people have world-changing ideas. Only those bold enough to act on them are the ones who make history and change the world. To be totally honest, we weren\u2019t looking to make history while sitting in that cafe. We just wanted to be able to make great tasting, refreshing, cold brew coffee in a short time.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was with that spark that we first patented the technology in South Korea in 2015. \u00a0What followed was an international PTC patent. Thankfully dominos began to fall in the right direction. Followed by ten more patents. \u00a0Including 6 domestically, 2 in Japan, 1 in China and 1 in the United States of America. \u00a0These patents and the support of various governments opened the door to our current situation.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re excited for you to help join us in bringing our innovative device to life. As such we\u2019ve developed a tiered pledge system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Since the first conception of the product back in 2017, we have come a long way! Taking our expertise and years of trial and error refining the cold brew coffee making, we are proud that we achieved another milestone in the coffee industry, Super Sonic H.\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you very much for supporting us and we will keep our promise to deliver the product. Based on our current estimated timeline, we look to ship out the first batch in January 2022.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It can also be really dangerous and stressful.\u00a0\n\nClose passes by overtaking cars are the biggest cause of fatal or serious accidents involving cyclists. Road rage is on the rise as communication between cyclists and motorists is limited, and we have little understanding of the safest route to cycle across our city. tether was invented to solve this problem and connect to a new community that create safer roads for everyone the more they use it.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat it does\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0tether attaches to your handlebars and projects what we call 'The Bubble' a safe zone around your bike, \u00a0encouraging drivers to give you enough space as they overtake.\nEmbedded sensors continuously monitor and detect other road users and overtaking vehicles, publishing this in real time to a companion app.\nLocations of overtakes are recorded to identify safe and unsafe zones in your city to help plan safer routing.\n\nFunctionality & experience\ntether has been designed to attach to any handlebars, top stem or down stem giving a clear line of sight for the sensors and allowing the projection to display around the bike.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent functionality and experience:\n\nTurning on the device activates the projection and sensors which will trigger a change in the projection with an overtake within 1.5m.\nConnect the app via bluetooth, the sensors pick up absolute distances up to 2.5m, that means it can identify all overtakes whether they are too close or safe. These readings are collected and sent to the app multiple times a second. At the same time GPS is recorded to identify the types of overtakes on different roads.\nThe app works in the background so you can lock your phone screen and put it in your pocket while you ride, but the readings are shown on screen to check everything is working before you set off.\nAt the end of your ride end the session on the phone and the data is automatically uploaded to the cloud with everyone else's.\n\nThe final refinements will include:\u00a0\n\nWidening the projection so that it is easier to see when approaching a cyclist from behind.\u00a0\nReplacing the current 3d printed (in SLS) with a really sleek aluminium machined casing, anodised in black and a limited edition of colours available. \u00a0\nReplacing the bolt on the attachment with a quick release thumb screw to take your device with you easily when you lock your bike up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifications\n\n\u00a0Power: Prototypes are using a rechargeable lithium battery (though exploring the use of larger cells), the current prototypes last up to 6 hours for continuous use, taking around 1 hour to fully charge. Charging is by a micro USB (cable \u00a0comes in the box).\n\u00a0Dimensions: 127mm x 74mm x 46mm\n\u00a0Materials: The casing is machined aluminum, bead blasted back, looks great and subtle on the bike.\n\u00a0Waterproofing: Sealed to ensure the internals are protected in the rain, definitely London proof.\u00a0\n\u00a0Attachment: Attachments are provided to fix tether onto your handlebars, the top stem, or down stem with an easy bolt to unfasten by hand to easily take it off when you park up.\n\u00a0Brightness: Super bright 10mW LED lasers.\u00a0\n\u00a0Sensors: Sensors in the right left and front can detect objects distance up to 2.5m accurately able to distinguish the type of vehicle based on the profile of sensor readings.\n\u00a0PCB: Our custom PCB designed, and lovingly hand soldered act as the nerve centre of the device, connecting via bluetooth to the app, and controlling the sensors and projection.\u00a0\n\nUnder the hood\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur pre production prototype is fully functional and being road tested to iron out the final kinks, we have established relationships with component suppliers, with PCBs and casings being manufacured right here in London. Our assembly is also done in our workshop in Bethnal Green. We have spent a year developing prototypes, testing out different technologies, approaches and incorporating feedback from our early adopters. Narrowing down to a prototype that is easy to attach and universal to all handlebars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0tether is designed, assembled and manufactured in the U.K. between our design studio in Peckham and our manufacturing shop in Shoreditch, good for product quality, ethically manufactured and good for our carbon footprint too.\nWhat's unique about it?\ntether is designed to connect you to a community to create safe cycling routes for one another. The more people have and use tether the more we learn about which areas of your city are safe or unsafe to ride through.\nThe sensors are the clever part, they are similar to the parking sensors in cars, they detect passing vehicles on either side and in front. Readings are taken and the distances of overtakes recorded (up to 2.5m) and sent in real time to the app. \u00a0We've even figured out a way to distinguish between people, cars, lamposts buses and even dogs...\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe app records the GPS location of where overtakes are happening, based on how safe (or unsafe) those overtakes are we can analyse and display routes for you to travel on safer and stress free.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWe found that there are lots of different types of handlebars out there, by working with our early adopters and attaching and testing it to multiple bikes we are confident tether can attach to any bike and any handlebar.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly adopters\u00a0\nOur pre production prototype is being road tested with everyday cyclists, couriers, and commuters with folding bikes.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\"WOW, there you go (when turning it on for the first time\" C.O. Commuter, rides an old school road bike\n\u201cI spend so much money on bike tech, and this would actually make me safer and help me be on the front foot with letting drivers know, this is my space. All the drivers in London hate couriers like me.\u201d Jeremy, courier, rides an ebike\n\"I think the projection of cyclist safe space is great but the idea of the community creating safe cycling routes for one another is something I've not seen before.\" J.K commuter and weekend warrior\u00a0\nOur vision: What's Next\nWe are currently in testing with our early adopters and aiming to fund the 1st production run of 200 with the funds raised on Kickstarter. We have chosen to limit the first run to 200 to keep quality high, ensure manufacturing and assembly can stay in the UK and most importantly to ensure that the team can be dedicated to service and support our early backers, before moving onto the next stages of our roadmap.\nWe hope this first stage will prove the demand for a product like this and provide us with enough data to identify problematic or dangerous areas of the cities where our users are riding. In the long run we are interested in developing tether for other forms of micromobility from skateboards to scooters, and that the patterns we uncover can be used by courier fleets or planning better cycling infrastructure for cities.\nOrigin Story\u00a0\nwww.tether.bike\nIn March of 2020 - ether emerged as a skunkworks project from goya design studio with a small team of engineers and designers from Loughborough University (where Omar graduated from). Starting as an idea to help people socially distance during their outdoor exercise during lockdown we quickly uncovered the dangers cyclists face by closely overtaking cars. Omar the founder of goya was himself knocked off his bike in a similar way 20 years earlier, suffering a bad head injury.\nWorking remotely the team developed the initial prototypes, testing behind closed doors until we successfully applied for a patent protection which is currently pending."

You can even charge your phone in the USB-C and let your phone rest in the handle during charging.\nYou can charge the speaker or your phone while playing music on the speaker.\n\nAudio that outperforms\nWe love sound and we care about good quality sound. The Enkl speaker exceeds expectations for sound quality in a Bluetooth speaker. \u00a0Our precision-engineered acoustics deliver clarity, depth and fullness that you would expect from wired Hi Fi speakers.\u00a0\n\n\n\nTested by acoustics experts in our anechoic chamber\n\n\nTech Insider: Bluetooth\nWe believe in 'Bluetooth First'. Because Bluetooth gives you ultimate freedom of movement and usability. Here are some of our takes on Bluetooth:\n\nWe use hardware based on BT 5.2. and a special implementation of BT Low Energy Audio (BLE Audio) sprinkled with proprietary knowhow. BLE Audio is the Bluetooth standard of the future and we are probably one of the first companies to implement. With all the improvements BLE Audio brings we see this as the wireless audio interface on which innovation will be based for the decades to come, and we are proud and humbled being one of the companies leading the way.\nWe want to make sound simple and with the advent of Bluetooth 5.2 this is now even more possible as BLE Audio besides very high efficiency and lower latency also allows for lossless audio codex. In audio applications where there was previously a need for cables or energy consuming wireless technologies to keep latency low and resolution high, these are now obsolete. Just the benefits remain.\nWith our implementation of BT 5.2 compatible hardware its possible to connect to unlimited devices which means that you can combine several Enkl Speakers as a sound system. With the Enkl App, you can choose which speakers should be right, left or centre.\n\nTech Insider: Sound\nThe Enkl Sound speaker is a one-point music system with immersive and powerful sound.\u00a0\n\nThe acoustic set up of comprises two 10'' neodymium woofer bass drivers for powerful bass performance and a one 1,5'' Ceramic Horn Tweeterall jointly developed with Italian B&C group and combined with a bass port.\u00a0\nThe acoustic system which is powered by 320 watts from two pairs of low distortion Multilevel Class-D amplifiersand controlled by an in-system DSP is expertly tuned and delivers exceptional clarity and depth, giving the user an up to studio-quality listening experience at home or powerful sound on the go.\nThe Enkl Sound speaker also uses our proprietary dynamic bass system which presents a big sound image at lower volumes, and the listener can thus hear the deepest richest bass notes. Most traditional speakers can\u2019t do this, regardless of brand or price.\n\nAudio interface \u2013 Bluetooth First\n The Enkl Speaker relies solely on BT as media interface. With the advent of Bluetooth Low Energy Audio (BLE Audio) introduced with Bluetooth 5.2, we believe this is right platform for the years to come. BLE Audio is not only highly energy effective \u2013 with the Enkl Sound implementation it also supports the Low Complexity Communication Codec (LC3)which promises a much greater audio quality at even lower bit rate levels than its predecessor; the standard SBC codecs. Some listeners even prefer the LC3 above third-party Bluetooth solutions such as e.g., AptX (Qualcomm) or LDAC (Sony) codecs. We do too.\n\n\nSuppliers & partners\n\n\n\nWorking with renown partners in the industry\n\n\nEasy to connect\nWhy should it be a hazzle for people in the same household or a group of friends to connect to their Bluetooth speaker? Enkl Sound marks an end of pairing your phone with the speaker and makes it seamless to shift between users. You as an owner can let multiple users connect to the speaker. When you and they have paired once, and you have accepted them once, all users are automatically on.\u00a0\n\nYour phone and all users' phone is a remote control and all users can control the speaker. So your phone is your phone. There is no need to share your phone anymore - you just share the music.\u00a0\n\nWith the always-on function, you even don\u2019t have to get up and turn it on/off.\n\n\n\nEasy to connect and control the speaker with the Enkl app\n\n\nFirst ever multi-user access\nThis is NEW and groundbreaking technology and we are extremely happy to make it possible to share the music experience and give access to unlimited users. Now Enkl Sound makes it possible with multi user access in Bluetooth speakers. Welcome to a new standard based on Bluetooth 5.2 and BLE Audio technology.\n\nYou as an owner can give access to unlimited users in the Enkl App. This means that:\n- All users in your household or group of friends are automatically on and you do no longer need to pair with the Bluetooth device to shift between users.\n- All users can control the speaker and get access to all functionalities. Simply download the app.\n- You as an owner can control the users and give the limited or umlimites access.\n\nMulti-user access will be available in early 2022 app update.\n\n\n\nConnects unlimited users\n\n\n\nYour phone as microphone\nAlways a microphone nearby that you don\u2019t need to share. Use your phone or Bluetooth headset as microphone. Easy to give a speach, sing along or use for sport lessons. Simply turn on/off in the app. This is yet another great invention by Enkl Sound.\nPhone as microphone will be available in early 2022 app update.\n\n\n\nFor speaches, service messages or even karaoke\n\n\n\nEnkl Sound System with multi-speakers\nConnect more than 10 speakers to an Enkl Sound System. Set right/left/mid/bass for a professional and powerful setup. Start sharing with multi users on multi speakers.\n\n\n\nConnect 10+ Enkl speakers to an Enkl Sound System\n\n\nLoud to the limit\n125 dB \u2013 the level of a live concert with hundreds of people outdoor. Very powerful acoustic sound to go. However, there might be situations where you don't want your speaker to be able to play that loud.\u00a0\nThe owner can control the volume by setting a loudness limit in the app. This means that no users can play louder than the loudness limit set by the owner.\n\n\n\nSet start level & loudness limit in the app. Volume also to be controlled on the speaker control panel or from your phone.\n\n\nExtreme portability\nThe Enkl Speaker is the most lightweight Bluetooth speaker at 125 dB. With only 10 kg and less than 50L it is the smallest and most lightweight Bluetooth speaker at 125 dB.\u00a0\n\nMaterials are extremely durable, and are drop resistant and water resistant with IPX4.\n\nAn alu handle on the back makes it easy to carry your Enkl Speaker.

        "Text": "This small campaign is focused on a single type artifact: the Monotype Electro Display Matrix, developed by the Monotype Company in the early 1900s to cast large multiples of individual pieces of type. The funds raised by the campaign cover the cost of producing an accurate 3D model of a single matrix, suitable for 3D output, and making 3D prints to fulfill campaign rewards.\nUnderstanding the past often requires the means to study it. In my research over the last several years into the history of printing and typefounding and typesetting, I\u2019ve collected many artifacts that give me insight into how things were made and how that affected publishing, design, and the spread of information.\nMany printing artifacts are in short supply, as they haven\u2019t been manufactured in several decades or much longer. To gain access to limited tools, you can make fresh copies of them\u2014and 3D scanning, modeling, and printing is a fantastic modern technique that can bring the past back to life.\u00a0\nI need your help to produce and refine a model of the Electro Display Matrix and release it in the world.\u00a0\n\n\n\nA historic Electro Display Matrix with scuffs and marks from being in use and being idle\n\n\nCampaign backers will receive the 3D file first. But to further cultural and technological understanding, six months after backers get access, I will distribute the file under a Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0 license, which permits any use with attribution, allowing its wide distribution. This will allow others with the interest to have a perfected model to reproduce or build from without starting from scratch.\nReward tiers include:\n\nThe 3D file, suitable for printing or sending to a service bureau to print\nA 3D-printed version of the matrix in at least PLA, but possibly higher-grade material\nA historic Electro Display Matrix (shown below), available in a limited quantity\nA historic Super Cast matrix at the top reward tier, used for larger sizes of type\n\nThis project is the first foray into what I hope will be a future series of 3D models of printing artifacts. I drew inspiration for this project from the 3Dhotbed teaching tools developed as a collaboration of the Texas A&M University Book History Workshop, Cushing Memorial Library, and Texas A&M University.\nBecause I don\u2019t yet have the model made, I can\u2019t show you what they would look like. However, I can show an example of something comparable, the type punch from the 3Dhotbed project. In the image below, this is how the model appears in 3D-printer preparation software, as a print in PLA material, and as a 3D print in metal.\n\n\n\nExample of a similar project: previewing the print (left), print in PLA (center), print in metal (right)\n\n\n\n\n\nA case of historic Electro Display Matrices\n\n\nThis Artifact\u2019s Place in Typecasting\nThe Electro Display Matrix is one of several kinds of molds (or matrices) used to create type by casting it in a liquid lead alloy, which fills the mold and quickly cools and hardens. The size and type of mold varied with the point size of the type. The Electro Display Matrix was used for display type, from 14 to 36 points.\nA type-foundry worker would mount the Electro Display Matrix into a holder and place it in a specialized typecasting machine. They could then monitor the machine as it produced hundreds to thousands identical pieces of metal type per hour. Each piece would emerge in its nearly finished condition, ready to be added to a font\u2014a set of metal type at a specific size in one style\u2014and shipped off to a printer or put in storage for future orders.\n\n\n\nIllustration of matrix (left) and casting machine (right)\n\n\nThe Electro Display Matrix is a thing of beauty, containing two types of metal and involving machining, stamping, and an electrochemical deposition process called electrotyping.\nIn electrotyping, a model of what the finished piece of metal type should look like is inserted into a cavity in a piece of machined and stamped bronze. The process deposits copper onto the model, forming the mold when the model is removed. See images for illustrations of this process.\n\n\n\nAn illustration of the electrotyping process to prepare to make a matrix from Electrolytic Matrices by Phil. T. Nuernberger\n\n\n\nEach number on the mold refers to the font of which it is part, its width, its size, and other technical characteristics. The finished matrix\u2019s dimensions are 1.125 by .75 by 0.094 inches. Beveled edges allowed it to be locked into place in the casting machine.\nElectrotyping allowed a massive increase in the variety and production of type in the latter half of the 19th century and Monotype and other companies further accelerated that by creating a standardized mold to cast type.\nSome modern experimenters have replicated the process on a very limited scale, as producing these molds in quantity required industrial operations.\n\n\n\nElectro Display Matrices and other type molds produced metal type of varying sizes, like those shown here.\n\n\nWhat the Campaign Will Achieve\nThis campaign will pay for the cost of 3D scanning, modeling, and prototyping a copy of a single matrix. I am working with an established 3D modeling firm that has produced work of similar complexity from original objects and has given me a firm estimate for the work to be performed.\nPart of your pledge supports releasing the 3D model for broad use without fee or restriction.\nThe commitment of this campaign is that the matrix will be 3D-printed in PLA (polylactic acid), a hard plastic-like material. However, depending on the final costs of production and the volume of items ordered, I hope to be able to upgrade that to 3D printing in some form of metal. All backers who pledge for a 3D-printed matrix will receive the upgrade if the budget allows for it.\nMany Monotype matrices remain in use at active type foundries around the world, such as M&H Type in San Francisco (part of the non-profit Grabhorn Institute) and the Bixler Press & Letterfoundry in New York. However, I regularly come across small sets of Electro Display Matrices that are not in the right condition for typecasting. A cleaned-up matrix from a recovered set is part of the higher-tier rewards, like the one shown below. (My intent is never to remove material from circulation that could be used by active letterpress printers or type foundries.)\u00a0\n\n\n\nFront, back, and receding view of a historic matrix\n\n\nThis campaign will help preserve the past, spread knowledge about the technology, and give backers a unique replica or actual piece of printing history.\nBackers at the top tier will receive two 3D-printed and two historic Electro Display Type matrices and one Super Caster master, of the kind shown below.\n\n\n\nSuper Caster matrix, part of the top-tier reward\n\n\nShipping and Taxes\nShipments within the United States: This project\u2019s reward prices include sales tax for shipments made to addresses within Washington State in the United States.\nShipments outside the United States: I do not collect GST, VAT, or import duties for items shipped outside the United States. You may be required to pay the delivery company taxes or duties when physical items arrive in your country. These often range from between 10% to 25%, depending on the country."

        "Text": "\u00a0\"The single coolest thing to happen to music ever.\" \u2014 Thomas O\u2019Hara, age 12\u00a0\nHyperscore is a revolutionary music composition software developed at the famed M.I.T. Media Laboratory. Designed by a team led by Tod Machover (called by the LA Times \"America's most wired composer\"), Hyperscore is simple, intuitive, and fun to use while enabling children and adults to compose complex, original music without requiring years of training.\u00a0\nHere's how Hyperscore works:\n\n\n\n\u00a0Thousands of children have used Hyperscore in Machover's Toy Symphony and City Symphony projects, creating compositions that have been performed by renowned orchestras, rock and jazz bands, and numerous other artists. Hyperscore was previously available only as software running on Windows, which severely limited its use in classrooms and by the public. But we have now licensed Hyperscore from M.I.T. and redeveloped it as a Web app that works on any desktop, laptop, or notebook computer with an internet connection. Our mission is to empower children (and adults too) to find their voice through music composition using the web-based version of Hyperscore.\u00a0\nThis fall, we have been beta testing Hyperscore for the Web in two dozen classrooms in the U.S., Canada, and Germany.\u00a0Teachers have told us that students are being creative, helping one another with tips on using Hyperscore and wishing that class time would not end. (Now that's music to a teacher's ears!)\nBy backing our campaign, you will enable us to complete the software development needed to release Hyperscore to schools as well as the general public. This backend software will position us to generate sales revenue so that we can provide Hyperscore to schools with limited arts budgets, while sustaining our operations for years to come. As a backer, you will receive access to Hyperscore for your personal enjoyment while helping to put this wonderful technology into the hands of budding composers everywhere.\n\u00a0\u201cThe whole orchestra and I unanimously agree that [Toy Symphony] is one of the most\u00a0important things we have ever done...\u201d \u00a0\u2013 Kent Nagano, conductor, Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin"

Storage is modular, and allows you to add any two SATA compatible SSDs.\n\nPowered by Raspberry Pi\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 is at the core of PiBox. Our standard bundle includes 8GB of RAM, 8GB of built-in storage, and WiFi. If you pick the hacker bundle reward (i.e. carrier boards only), you will need to supply your own CM4, which is available in 32 variants, with a range of RAM, eMMC Flash, and WiFi options. A Micro SD card slot is present on the PiBox boards, so you are able to use the \"Lite\" variants without onboard storage.\n\nHacker Friendly\nWith a Raspberry Pi at the core, PiBox is the most hackable NAS on the market. We broke out the GPIO pins so you can wire up sensors and Pi HATs, and even included a header for 2 extra USB ports in case you want to install it in a larger case. On the front panel, there's a user-controllable RGB LED and a 1.3\" LCD that you can use for displaying any information you want.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetter than the Cloud\nReplace expensive cloud bills with PiBox. PiBox lets you easily migrate from Google Photos to PhotoPrism, or from DropBox to Nextcloud, and many more. Pibox runs new self-hosted applications at the click of a button.\n\nThis video shows how you can install PhotoPrism on your PiBox:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPowered by KubeSail\nKubeSail is optional software that helps you\n\nInstall and manage new software easily via templates\u00a0\nAccess the software on your PiBox anywhere in the world, securely, even behind a firewall\nBackup your PiBox's software configuration and data regularly\n\nWe built KubeSail in order to make it easy to self-host apps, wherever they live. We ship KubeSail software with PiBox and hope you enjoy it, but you are never locked in or forced to use it. PiBox is deeply rooted in an open ecosystem and we have instructions on how to flash your PiBox from scratch if you enjoy tinkering!\n\nCustomizable LCD Display and LEDs\nBy default, the front of PiBox shows important stats about your PiBox. You can customize the screen to show anything else, such as the Weather, Tweets, or even your favorite cat GIFs. The top indicator is a tri-color RGB LED, wired to three separate GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi, so its easy to customize. Install some software that takes advantage of these features, or write your own!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSilent Operation\nThe PiBox emits a PWM control signal so the fan only spins as fast as necessary. This makes it quieter than even the Official Raspberry Pi Case fan, and keeps the CPU from experiencing large temperature swings, which should lead to longer CPU life for your Pi. Typically this is done via a dedicated controller chip that is impossible to buy currently, due to the ongoing chip shortage. But thanks to some clever code from alwynallan on GitHub, we are able to ship a silent PiBox now, with no delays.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen, Hackable, and Upgradable\nThe PiBox is designed to be opened. All the components are modular and upgradable, including the backplane and carrier board. For example, this means that you can continue to use the expensive Raspberry Pi Compute Module and SSDs, even if you later decide you need a PiBox with more ports, or a larger front display.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY Edition (Hacker Bundle) - 10 Minute Assembly Video\nThis video shows the assembly instructions for the DIY edition of PiBox. In this reward tier, we provide the carrier and backplane boards, and the rest is up to you. You will need to provide your own Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4, Cooling Fan, 15W+ USB-C Power Supply, CM4 WiFi Antenna, \u00a01.3\" LCD Display, Case (3D Printed or Metal), and one or two SSD drives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet the Creators\n\n\n\n\n\nHi there! We're Dan and Seandon. After becoming friends while working and scaling up servers at Imgur, we founded the startup KubeSail with a goal of making home-hosting awesome. The most common complaint we kept hearing is that it was a hassle to get good home server hardware (existing options were too small and slow, or too big and loud). We designed a fits-in-the-palm-of-your-hand server based on the latest Raspberry Pi CM4 and ultra-fast SSDs, and you can customize it! - Buy the stand-alone hardware or combine it with KubeSail.com for apps, dynamic DNS, web-forwarding, backups and more!"

Therefore, these grips only constitute a compromise. For many people it is mostly a bad one, because every hand is different.\n\nIn addition, the vast majority of bicycle grips are made of rubber and start to become sticky after a short time. This is caused by the plasticizers contained in the material, which dissolve from the handle due to UV radiation and sweat.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur solution turns the bicycle grip market on its head: a bike grip that is 3D printed to fit the individual cyclist with just a photo of the hand, therefore providing optimum support. The grip is made of silicone, which contains no plasticizers, therefore it will never become sticky and will last for many years.\n\n\nBenefits & Features\n\u00a0\ud83e\udd17 Numb hands will be a thing of the past\u00a0\nThe bike grip from Personomic is custom-made for your hands. We take the individual characteristics of your hand into account, such as the width and length of your fingers and your palm. This allows for a perfect fit.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe force is distributed evenly across your hand and there are no pressure peaks that compress the nerves \u2014 similar to an orthopaedic insole.\nThe enlarged surface with the wing also supports your wrist and prevents hyperextension, one of the main reasons for numb or tingling fingers.\n\n\u267b\ufe0f Silicone prevents stickiness\u00a0\nRegular bike grips made of rubber quickly start to become sticky because of the plasticizers they contain.\nWe have recognized this problem and therefore use silicone, because it is extremely abrasion-resistant and guaranteed not to become sticky \u2013 you will be able to enjoy your grips for years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\ud83d\udc8e Your own design\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWe specify the shape of the grip and you design it. You can let your creativity run wild with the design and choose from over 350 design combinations. Choose the color, texture and lock rings. You can even have the handle engraved, making your dream grip unique to you.\u00a0\n\n\ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea Quality 100% made in Germany\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use only the best materials and manufacture in Germany to offer a premium grip. With the company Rapid Shape, we have gained one of the world's leading manufacturers of 3D printing systems as a partner to guarantee the best possible quality in production.\n\n\n\ud83d\udce2 Reviews of our testers\n\u2014 These reviews have been translated from German to English \u2014\nFrom the outset, we have developed the bike grips with passionate cyclists and have incorporated their feedback into the development. This allowed us to develop a grip that is tailored precisely to the needs of cyclists.\nI have now tested the bike grips extensively and their shape is just incredible. I've never experienced such a pleasant grip before and I've run through lots in the past. I tore a ligament in my left hand 2 months ago due to a fall. With the bike grips there are no issues whatsoever. They support the injured hand really well. \u2014 Hjalmar P. from Bochum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI didn't feel any tingling or numbness in my hands. My problems stem from my thumb basal joint because of arthritis, but that also became much, much better. On longer tours they have always hurt a lot, but with the new grips there was a lot of improvement. \u2014 Silvia A. from Kirf\n\n\n\n\n\nThe different surfaces (asphalt, gravel) did not lead to any (negative) changes in my hands ... the bike grips simply \"swallowed\" the vibrations, which I personally find important.\n... Conclusion: if the grips are positioned correctly, they bring (me) noticeable relief. The problems with my hands have become significantly better, even on long-distance tours. \u2014 Susanne K. from Muenster\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Facebook, the young start-up Personomic was looking for testers for their custom-made and ergonomic bicycle grips. With a bit of luck, I was chosen as a tester due to my history of rheumatism and have now been testing these grips for 4 weeks and about 400 km. I am absolutely thrilled\u00a0how these grips have improved my \"cycling life\". \u2014 Andreas K. from Schwalbach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd90 Real world studies prove the effectiveness\nThe reviews of our testers are confirmed by pressure analyses. In a study conducted by the University of Stuttgart, our custom-made bicycle grips were compared with six other ergonomic grips available on the market.\n\n\n\n\n\nForce measurements showed that compared to conventional bicycle grips, our grips are the best at reducing both the pressure peaks on the palm as well as the surface pressure.\n\n\n\ud83d\udce6 Rewards\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the grips, you can order end plugs and lock rings as add-ons to use them as spare parts if needed.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is how you get your grips:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udca1 How it works\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 \u00a0Scan your hands\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore your grips go into production, we will ask you to scan your hands on our website. All you need is a smartphone with which you can take a photo of each hand on a sheet of paper. The photos will then be sent to us.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are compatible with both DIN-A4 and US letter formats.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Customize your grip\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter you have successfully scanned your hands, you can design the grip according to your own design preferences in the configurator. \u00a0\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 \u00a0We measure your hands\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can measure your hand with just one photo. The sheet of paper serves as a reference object whose exact dimensions we know. With your hand measurements, we then create a freely movable 3D model of your hand.\nSimilar to orthopaedic insoles, our software creates a virtual imprint of your hand including the palm rest and grip recesses.\n\u00a0\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 \u00a0We create your grips\n\n\n\n\n\nWe then print a mold that has the shape of your hand and cast it with silicone. The result is a bike grip that fits your hand perfectly and will never become sticky.\n\n\n\u2705 Fact sheet\n\n\n\n\n\n* Handlebars are standardized. You can measure yours if you are unsure.\n** We plan to offer shortened grips for grip shifters in 2022.\n\n\ud83d\udce6 \u00a0What's in the box\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83e\udde9 \u00a0Textures\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udf08 \u00a0Colors\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd12 \u00a0Lock rings\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u23f1 Timeline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude9a Shipping\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that you will be responsible for any potential import duties, taxes and customs fees after the shipment arrives in your country (not valid if you reside in the EU).\nAfter the end of the crowdfunding campaign and before the start of production, you will be asked to scan your hands as well as choose the design of your grips. During this process, you will also be able to set your delivery address.\n\n\n\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udf84 The perfect gift\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to give your loved ones a really unique present for christmas or their birthday?

However, common cycling-related hand discomfort is a problem because it limits people's ability to ride their bikes. That's why we use high-tech 3D printers to enable people to ride their bikes without any discomfort.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we met in 2020 just when the COVID-19 pandemic started, we were faced with the question of how to proceed in our lives. Due to the uncertainty, it was obvious that we should use the crisis to start our own company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe created the first prototype of the bicycle grip using impression material that is usually used by dentists. Through these experiments, a rough shape for the bicycle grip emerged quickly. Finally, we set the final design after many iterations.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were already on German national TV with our grips. Moreover, we were able to present our grips to thousands of cyclists at the VELOFrankfurt and Eurobike bike fairs. The feedback we received was overwhelming.\nWith your help, we now want to make the bicycle grips available to as many people as possible!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeutsch \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea\nDer Fahrradgriff von Personomic ist der letzte Griff, den du brauchen wirst: im 3D-Druck individuell auf deine Hand angepasst, gefertigt aus 100 % Silikon gegen l\u00e4stiges Verkleben und au\u00dferdem von dir nach deinen Vorlieben designbar.\nMit deinem eigenen ma\u00dfgefertigten Fahrradgriff geh\u00f6ren Handbeschwerden der Vergangenheit an.\n\n\n\n\n\nW\u00e4hrend der Entwicklung der Griffe konnten wir auf unser Netzwerk, bestehend aus Ergonomiespezialisten sowie Personen mit medizinischem Hintergrund, zur\u00fcckgreifen.\nUnabh\u00e4ngige Studien haben gezeigt, dass Personomic-Griffe die Druckbelastung auf die H\u00e4nde hervorragend reduzieren und damit Handproblemen, die beim Radfahren h\u00e4ufig auftreten, vorbeugen bzw. diese reduzieren.\nDie Griffe passen auf fast alle Lenkerstangen, da diese standardisiert sind. Au\u00dferdem sind sie zu 100 % in Deutschland hergestellt, was f\u00fcr ihre Qualit\u00e4t b\u00fcrgt.\n\nBekannt aus:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem & L\u00f6sung\nAls Fahrradfahrer kennt man das Problem. Ob beim Sattel oder beim Fahrradgriff, oft hat man es mit Taubheitsgef\u00fchlen, Kribbeln oder Schmerzen zu tun, die einem das Fahrradfahren richtig vermiesen k\u00f6nnen.\nFahrradgriffe werden bisher nur in Standardgr\u00f6\u00dfen angeboten, die im Hinblick auf eine Durchschnittshand entwickelt wurden. Dadurch stellen sie nur einen Kompromiss dar. F\u00fcr viele Leute meistens einen Schlechten, weil jede Hand anders ist.\n\n\n\n\n\nDar\u00fcber hinaus wird die gro\u00dfe Mehrheit der Fahrradgriffe aus Gummi hergestellt und f\u00e4ngt nach kurzer Zeit an, klebrig zu werden. Das liegt an den enthaltenen Weichmachern, die sich aufgrund der UV-Strahlung und Schwei\u00df aus dem Griff l\u00f6sen.\u00a0\nUnsere L\u00f6sung stellt den Markt f\u00fcr Fahrradgriffe auf den Kopf: Ein Fahrradgriff, der mit nur einem Foto der Hand im 3D-Druck auf den jeweiligen Fahrer angepasst wird und die Hand optimal entlastet. Durch das Aufgie\u00dfen mit Silikon, welches keine Weichmacher enth\u00e4lt, wird der Griff nie verkleben und viele Jahre halten.\u00a0\n\n\nNutzen & Eigenschaften des Griffs\n\u00a0\ud83e\udd17 Einschlafende H\u00e4nde geh\u00f6ren der Vergangenheit an\u00a0\nDer Fahrradgriff von Personomic wird f\u00fcr deine H\u00e4nde ma\u00dfgefertigt. Wir ber\u00fccksichtigen dabei die individuellen Merkmale deiner Hand, wie z. B. die Breite und L\u00e4nge deiner Finger und deines Handtellers. Dadurch entsteht ein perfekter Fit.\n\n\n\n\n\nDie Kraft wird gleichm\u00e4\u00dfig auf deine Hand verteilt, und es kommt zu keinen Belastungsspitzen, die die Nerven in deiner Hand komprimieren \u2014 \u00e4hnlich wie bei einer orthop\u00e4dischen Schuheinlage.\nDer Entlastungsfl\u00fcgel st\u00fctzt au\u00dferdem dein Handgelenk und verhindert so ein Abknicken, einer der Hauptgr\u00fcnde f\u00fcr taube oder kribbelnde Finger.\n\n\u267b\ufe0f Kein Verkleben mehr dank Silikon\u00a0\nNormale Fahrradgriffe aus Gummi fangen aufgrund der darin enthaltenen Weichmacher schnell an, klebrig zu werden.\nWir haben dieses Problem erkannt und verwenden deshalb Silikon, weil es extrem abriebfest ist und garantiert nicht verklebt \u2014 du hast jahrelang Freude daran.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\ud83d\udc8e Dein eigenes Design\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWir geben die Form des Griffs vor und du designst ihn. Du kannst deiner Kreativit\u00e4t beim Design freien Lauf lassen und aus \u00fcber 350 Designkombinationen w\u00e4hlen. Ob Farbe, Klemmring oder Textur \u2014 am Ende kommt ein einzigartiger Griff heraus. Daf\u00fcr garantiert auch eine Gravur, die du w\u00e4hlen kannst.\u00a0\n\n\ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea Qualit\u00e4t 100 % Made in Germany\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWir verwenden nur die besten Materialien und produzieren selbst in Deutschland, um einen wirklichen Premium-Griff anzubieten. Mit der Firma Rapid Shape haben wir einen der weltweit f\u00fchrenden Anbieter f\u00fcr 3D-Druck-Systeme als Partner gewonnen, um die bestm\u00f6gliche Qualit\u00e4t in der Produktion zu garantieren.\n\n\n\ud83d\udce2 Erfahrungsberichte unserer Tester\nWir haben die Fahrradgriffe von Anfang an mit leidenschaftlichen Radfahrern entwickelt und haben deren Feedback mit in die Entwicklung einflie\u00dfen lassen. Dadurch konnten wir einen Griff entwickeln, der exakt auf die Bed\u00fcrfnisse von Fahrradfahrern abgestimmt ist.\u00a0\nIch habe die Griffe jetzt ausf\u00fchrlich getestet und die Form ist einfach mega. So angenehm war noch kein Griff und ich habe einige durch. Ich hatte vor 2 Monaten durch einen Sturz einen B\u00e4nderabriss an der linken Problemhand. Mit den Griffen habe ich null Probleme. Die verletzte Hand ist richtig gut gest\u00fctzt. \u2014 Hjalmar P. aus Bochum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIch hatte keinerlei Kribbeln oder Taubheitsgef\u00fchl in meinen H\u00e4nden. Mein Hauptproblem sind aber immer meine Daumengrundgelenke wegen Arthrose, aber auch das war viel, viel besser. Bei l\u00e4ngeren Touren haben die schon immer sehr geschmerzt, aber mit den neuen Griffen war das wirklich deutlich besser. \u2014 Silvia A. aus Kirf\n\n\n\n\n\nDie unterschiedlichen Untergr\u00fcnde (Asphalt, Schotter) f\u00fchrten zu keiner (negativen) Ver\u00e4nderung meiner H\u00e4nde \u2026 die Griffe haben das einfach \u201egeschluckt\u201c, was ich pers\u00f6nlich wichtig finde.\u00a0\n... Fazit: Wenn die Handgriffe richtig positioniert sind, bringen sie (mir) eine sp\u00fcrbare Erleichterung, so dass meine Handprobleme deutlich weniger sind \u2014 auch \u00fcber eine l\u00e4ngere Strecke. \u2014 Susanne K. aus M\u00fcnster\n\n\n\n\n\nBei Facebook wurden von dem jungen Start-Up Unternehmen Personomic Tester f\u00fcr ihre ma\u00dfgefertigten und ergonomischen Fahrradgriffe gesucht. Mit etwas Gl\u00fcck wurde ich mit meiner Rheuma-Vorgeschichte als Tester ausgesucht und teste diese Griffe jetzt seit 4 Wochen und ca. 400 km. Ich bin absolut begeistert, wie diese Griffe mir mein \u201eFahrradleben\u201c wieder verbessert haben. \u2014 Andreas K. aus Schwalbach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd90 Studien beweisen die Effektivit\u00e4t\u00a0\nDie Erfahrungsberichte unserer Tester werden von Druckanalysen best\u00e4tigt. In einer Studie der Universit\u00e4t Stuttgart wurden unsere ma\u00dfgefertigten Fahrradgriffe mit sechs weiteren am Markt erh\u00e4ltlichen ergonomischen Griffen verglichen.\n\n\n\n\n\nMotorische Kraftmessungen ergaben, dass unsere Griffe sowohl die Kraftspitzen auf die Handfl\u00e4che als auch die Fl\u00e4chenpressung am besten reduzieren.\n\n\n\ud83d\udce6 Belohnungen\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nZus\u00e4tzlich zu den Griffen kannst du als Add-ons noch weitere Endstopfen und Klemmringe als Ersatz oder farbliche Erg\u00e4nzung bestellen.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nSo kommst du zu deinem Griff:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udca1 So geht's\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 \u00a0Du scannst\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nBevor deine Griffe in Produktion gehen, scannst du deine H\u00e4nde auf unserer Webseite.

Weitverbreitete Handbeschwerden sind da nat\u00fcrlich ein Problem, weil sie die Fahrer unn\u00f6tig einschr\u00e4nken. Wir benutzen deshalb High-Tech, um Menschen beschwerdefreies Fahrradfahren zu erm\u00f6glichen.\n\n\n\n\n\nAls wir uns 2020 kennenlernten, standen wir p\u00fcnktlich zum Beginn der Coronapandemie vor der Frage, wie es beruflich bei uns weitergehen soll. Aufgrund der Unsicherheit war nichts naheliegender, als die Krise zu nutzen, um ein eigenes Unternehmen zu gr\u00fcnden.\n\n\n\n\n\nDen ersten Prototypen des Fahrradgriffs erstellten wir noch mit Abformmasse, wie sie bei Zahn\u00e4rzten Verwendung findet. Durch diese Versuche kristallisierte sich schnell eine grobe Form f\u00fcr den Fahrradgriff heraus. In vielen Iterationsstufen kamen wir dann zum finalen Design des Griffs.\n\n\n\n\n\nMit unseren Griffen waren wir drei Mal im Fernsehen zu sehen, u. a. in der SWR Landesschau und bei \u201eEinfach genial\u201c im MDR. Auf der VELOFrankfurt und Eurobike konnten wir au\u00dferdem tausenden Fahrradfahrern vor Ort unsere Griffe pr\u00e4sentieren. Das Feedback war \u00fcberw\u00e4ltigend.\nGemeinsam mit dir wollen wir jetzt die Fahrradgriffe einer breiten Masse an Menschen zur Verf\u00fcgung stellen!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 2,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $900M raised between them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

When we try to wipe them away, they get even more dirty and foggy. Our arms get tired when using our smartphones with our most comfortable poses. And we always had to zoom in and touch our smartphones when trying something new. Finally, I bet you had your fingers and wrists ache from using your smartphone too long.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe smart controllers, currently sold in the market, are still helpful. But, they have to be used after a little break to use while driving or working out. Also, a mouse or a presentation remote is not very portable. Its clicking noises would get annoying in quiet places. LitZERO has solved all these inconveniences of smart controllers with just a touch of a button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLitZERO is a controller that can be used with all smart devices with a Bluetooth system installed. Get your job done by swiping and touching LitZERO, instead of your smartphone. The soft-touch and response time it's not going to let you down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMouse Mode\nYou can move around like a mouse cursor and select, run, scroll front/back, etc. It would be just like using a laptop's touchpad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting the Mouse Pointer on Hold (For Scrolling Through Webcomics/ E-Books)\nPut the Mouse Cursor on hold, and you can drag top/bottom, left/right, drag, select, scroll back/forward, etc. When you push the button on the left or move to your desired spot, touch the center, and hold for 3 seconds, you can put the pointer on hold. (When using on the mouse mode)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe upgraded the select/run function and the scroll function to provide a smoother utilization of LitZERO. By doing so, it gives the users the exact same feeling of controlling with a mouse. Also, with the pointer holding mode, LitZERO was upgraded to handle tasks like scrolling through webcomics and pages with a single gesture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultimedia mode\nThis mode is most adequate for users when listening to music while camping or trying to listen to music, or answer a phone call while driving or working out.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nTake control of your music with simple gestures while moving or working out.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nJust simply attach LitZERO to your car, bike, or backpack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLitZERO can also be used as a shutter for a camera, other than just enjoying a movie or some music.\n\n\n\n\n\nLitZERO would be phenomenal for those that enjoy watching Netflix or YouTube. Skipping back to the previous screen, fast forward, volume control, they are just the beginning of what LitZEROcan does. Now, enjoy your music/ movie while you are entirely laid back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0e-book / Video mode\u00a0\nWhile reading your books (webcomics, stories) digitally, flip through your pages hassle-free. You can flip through your pages with LitZERO sensing your gestures instead of you having to physically go up and touch your device's screen. Which wouldn't limit the users from watching online courses, Netflix, and YouTube.\n\n\n\n\n\nPage Mode\nWhen presenting your PowerPoint during a lecture or a meeting, all you need is LitZERO. You can control your PowerPoint with simple gestures, without a bulky mouse or a pointer. It's because, LitZERO is programmed for Keynotes, PDFs, documents, memos, other apps, and etc.\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment mode\nThis mode is mapped with the directional key and a mouse. You can move and run the apps, visible on Android OS, and control videos. The Experiment mode will allow users to start mapping their keys via an app shortly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo sense the user's fingers, LitZEROis equipped with high-sensitivity static touchpads. These static touchpads can sense over 80 touches a second to instantly respond to user inputs. When a user inputs a touch pattern, a signal intaking algorithm allows LitZERO to output 12 different touch gestures or different coordinates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe went through countless challenges and tried to bring extremely sensitive and precise skills to life. And finally, it was able to be completed up to perfection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLitZERO's wireless Bluetooth connection can last up to 15M max. So even though the user might be distant from their smart device, its phenomenal connectivity allows you to take control. Not only \u00a0LitZERO can control your wireless earbuds' volumes, but it also enables users to leave their remote controllers behind when taking pictures.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your smart device is equipped with standard Bluetooth technology, all of your devices are good to go with this multi-controller. Allowing up to pair with 8 smart devices is an even more crucial gadget for smartphone lovers like you! (Bluetooth enabled devices with Android 5.0 & up, MacOS, IOS 13 & up, Window 10 & up)\n\n\n\n\n\nSmartphones are gadgets that we just can't live without. Well, the critical functions of smartphones and LitZERO are very closely connected. Users can answer a phone call by double touching LitZERO. If they are not in the right time to respond, they can swipe down on the touchpad.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you left your smartphone in your car, or if you dropped it and walked away from it then, LitZERO would ring its alarm. With LitZERO's anti-theft functions, keep your smart devices nearby without the fear of losing them. Now you might think, what if I lost LitZERO? Well, if you lost your LitZERO, you can look up where its signal was lost on the LitAPP!\n\n\n\n\n\nLitZERO is also designed with braille on its main body to allow the visually challenged to efficiently use the device. These were all made possible thanks to the constructive feedback we received from our visually impaired customers of our previous model. (Which they truly enjoyed listening to music and watching dramas). This design was applied in the hopes that every individual can enjoy using LitZERO.

Or if it is fully charged then, the LED lights will turn blue.

How do you make sure you both share all the good times you\u2019ve imagined?\u00a0\n\nCreate a loving companion not a statistic.\nIn the U.S., about 1.5 million dogs enter shelters each year because of behavioral issues, and about 350,000 of them end up being euthanized. Those dogs were loved once, but some of their owners didn\u2019t know how to prevent the behavioral issues that made life unbearable for both of them. Even though training is essential for having a happy pet-owning family, many owners cannot find the time or support for the training their dog needs.\nThat\u2019s why we made the Sniffy App: to help create a loving companion not a statistic. You get clear guidance and personalized support you need in training, right on your phone.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Revolution in Dog Training\nThe Sniffy app puts a professional dog trainer in your pocket. Build a better lifetime bond with your furry buddy and tackle the most common issues with the help of structured, personalized, positive reinforcement training. Now, you don\u2019t have to add to your hectic day by scheduling training classes or searching through endless videos online. You can create a customizable training plan for you and your dog\u2019s specific needs, and get all the guidance and personalized support you need in each training session, right on your phone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* For more details about our planed training content for Sniffy 2.0, check out the Training Topics section on this page \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach dog learns differently and each owner has different training goals. That\u2019s why Sniffy lets you create a customizable plan where you choose the training topics that fit your dog and interest you most instead of forcing you into one general training plan.\nDogs are smart and can learn more than one thing at a time. You can help your dog become a happy and polite pup with our core training topics including \u201cBasic Manners,\u201d \u201cPolite Walking,\u201d \u201cReliable Recall,\u201d etc. We also have content for basic management of behaviors like barking and jumping. Sniffy includes special topics such as \u201cPuppy's First Lessons\u201d for new puppy owners and \u201cEnrichment\u201d for owners who have energetic dogs that need more exercise as well. We provide you with the essentials no matter where your new buddy comes from and what age they are.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot sure what skills to learn and practice in your training session? Wondering how often and how long you should practice to achieve your goals? Do you know what to do if your dog doesn\u2019t learn as fast as the dog in the video? Sniffy has got you covered.\nTraining definitely takes time, and you need to be consistent for the best results. With Sniffy, you can easily plan your daily training session based on our suggestions, your dog\u2019s performance and progress, or your interest and time. We help you establish a routine and achieve your end goal progressively. When things don\u2019t work out right away, you can always refer to the \"Not Working?\" section in the app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour training session is made up of watching video tutorials and practicing with your dog. Each tutorial includes a video as well as written instructions. Each of them is designed to teach you how to take baby steps toward success. Nothing more, nothing less. Our trainers and dogs will guide you through your plan and keep you motivated with their energy and demonstrated accomplishments. You will see the science behind positive reinforcement training instead of punishment, and learn how to apply these techniques yourself. You\u2019ll even be able to use them to create your own tricks!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are not alone in your training.

The first time I laid eyes on my cat, he had just been run over by a car. Seeing him struggle to the median with his front paws dragging his bloody back legs behind him, I stood shocked by the fight in him. I decided I would take care of him until his last day.\nAs much as I saved ZaiZai that day, over time he saved me by shining a light on my future. After years of not knowing my purpose, taking care of him made me realize what I wanted was simply to help create better relationships between humans and animals. I wanted all animals, not just humans, to live with dignity and receive better care. ZaiZai inspired me to leverage the power of technology to improve pet care.\nWith this goal in mind, I came to the U.S. to pursue a master\u2019s degree in Human-Computer Interaction at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). There I met my best friend, Ting. We worked together well on school projects and got good grades, but my heavy workload of school projects never got in the way of my ultimate dream.\nMy first idea of serving pets through technology was to build an app to make dog walking more fun. I knew that while at least two dog walks a day are important for dogs, many owners don\u2019t make the time simply because of boredom. So I asked Ting to join me in developing an app that would motivate owners to walk their dogs. We named it Sniffy.\nAfter interviewing 100 dog owners we learned that people would rather focus on their dog than an app while going for a walk together, and many of them mentioned behavioral issues that got in the way of enjoying that time and others. We pivoted our idea of a dog walking app into a dog training app. To turn the idea into a real product so it could benefit the most dogs and their families, we took programming and business classes, participated in student accelerators, and interviewed another 300 dog owners and trainers to investigate the current issues with dog training. We found that although many owners know their dogs need training, professional dog training resources are not easy to get. We knew an app could be the answer.\nWe found certified trainers who were passionate about this project and willing to collaborate with us. We made some training videos teaching dogs basic manners, built the beta app, and tested with 50 owners. 39 of them paid for our future product.\nOur videos were highly applauded for helping dogs learn basic skills. Nearly 60% of testers had tried group training before but found they didn\u2019t work because of distraction in class and both them and their dogs forgetting what to practice afterward. This is where Sniffy shines. Video tutorials show owners exactly what to do anytime and anywhere, and helpful reminders make training more consistent. Our testers saw their dogs\u2019 progress and were very satisfied with the beta app.\n\nSniffy is Proven and Will Get Even Better\nPositive feedback from early customers shows that Sniffy has the potential to shape more dogs into adored family members and enrich more owners' lives at the same time. Now our ultimate goal is to provide a platform that integrates training, pet care services, healthcare, nutrition, and other offerings into one streamlined service. We believe a system like this can reduce behavioral issues and pet abandonment and create happier pet-owning families. This is what drives us.\nYou can learn more about us at https://www.sniffy-app.com/about"

They are usually found in the annual sustainability reports that companies share with their stakeholders.\nSharing all this information is NOT MANDATORY.\nBut even if these data are made public, it is not always easy to compare them.\nFollowing the principle of the International Standard, the GRI 305 PARADIGMA makes the comparison simple and understandable to everyone!\nFor more details visit the official website \u00a0on the site you can also see a demonstration page of the operation.\n\nROAD MAP\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: from idea to product! \n In this phase we intend to collect the resources to develop the service and consolidate the partnerships.

        "Text": "What is going on here\nBack when released in 2014, the Inspire 1 was the first professional drone that allowed many more people to enter the UAV world for aerial photography and video shooting, without requiring high level skills on electronics and informatics that were the key for professional aircrafts at the time: it did just work.\nCountless camera operators and directors based their fleet on this powerful machinery, leveraging the ecosystem of gimbaled cameras, lenses and accessories that offered great versatility at a reasonable cost.\nIn our company we still use and fly the Inspire 1 regularly as today, and we believe that\u2019s still one of the most utilised drone worldwide; the reliability of this platform compared to its successor is drastically higher, and in a world of continuos, poorly-tested software updates, the fact that for years there were no more firmware upgrades is almost reassuring. Funny, isn't it?\n\n\n\nThey say \"If you have one drone, you have no drones. If you have two drones, you have one drone...\". We still didn't loose any to date. But we made a lot of repairs... and mods \ud83d\ude0e\n\n\nUnfortunately, DJI decided to forget this entire platform in favour of it's successor, the inspire 2, and with this, discontinue\u00a0essential spare parts as the TB47 and TB48 batteries.\nThis leds to the grounding of thousands of perfectly working drones, and all the money invested in this ecosystems by many businesses around the globe is flushed down the toilet with them\nAlso, in this era of environmental awareness, where everything needs to be rethinked to cope with sustainability needs, it is not acceptable to throw in the trash such good electronic parts, generating more unnecessary e-waste.\nHating this unbelievable situation, we decided to research and work on regenerating the precious batteries\u00a0on our own.\n\nThe interesting bits\nAs designers and manufacturers of electronic devices for a while, we went throught the rabbit hole of figuring out what is rotting badly in old batteries, why they stop working, perform poorely or even swell up.\nInside a TB47, TB48 and in general any other smart lithium battery you see around you, there is a big pack of lithium cells, and an electronic BMS that manages charging, discharging, balancing, temperature control and charge level.\nThe part that usually wears out with time and use is the cell pack; just replace it and... well, no.\nFirst of all, the cells used in drones are very high performance, as they need to pack an enormous amount of energy in a very confined space, and operate over a very wide temperature window.\nThen they are not in standard sizes, in fact standards don't even apply to lithium packs; we would need a custom made cell pack, assembled with custom made cells. Costly.\n\n\n\nThis is easy almost like building with Legos... but actually it is not.\n\n\nAnd finally, when this is sorted out, you need to please the small little brain that is inside the BMS, as he remembers the old, worn out cells; you need to introduce him his new partner, the new pack that is now as powerful as the original one he was shipped out with.\n\n\n\nIt's exactly as difficult as it looks\n\n\nYou'd reckon all of this requires a non-trivial amount of research and development, some guesswork and a crazy amount of testing, in order to ensure everything is working and the various parts are playing nicely together.\nAnd don't forget, even opening up these batteries is not a simple job, unless you want to end up with broken clips or warped plastics.\n\nSo...?\n... we did it!\n\n\n\nHope you appreciate the white looks\n\n\nWe figured out the BMS.\nWe designed the cells to fit into the casing.\nWe streamlined the production workflow.\nAnd we are starting to manufacture the cells! And this is also where the fun ends.\nWe do need to set up a production run for several hundreds of batteries, as we now manufacture the cells manually, which costs us a lot in terms of labour and materials.\nTB47 line is already up and running, and it costed A LOT. But at least, we can regenerate your batteries right now!\nWe also managed to gather a decent amount of old TB47 and regenerate them, so if you want to purchase them, we have them in stock!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut for TB48, we cannot sustain the hand-crafting of cells anymore; the other parts of the regeneration process, which include opening, disassembly, cleaning, testing and reassembly, are still necessarily performed by our skilled operators, but at least the cell production needs to be automated.\n\nOk so why should I trust you?\nOurs is a small company, but the KopterMax brand is quite well known in the drone industry; we've been the first manufacturing carbon fiber folding propellers for the Inspire 1 and 2, and the production is still active, with requests from customers happening regularly.\nWhen we started regenerating the first batteries, the news run fast, and we have been contacted from all over the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes electronics DO fail, and repair is needed\n\n\nOf course this has spurred us to create a product with an aesthetic appearance that lives up to expectations, but most importantly, with a very high reliability; we decided to offer a warranty of 6 months or 200 charging cycles, exactly the same as the original manufacturer provided.\n\n\n\nTesting, testing and finally more testing. EACH battery we ship is tested.\n\n\nWe are taking care of the entire regeneration process here at the KopterMax HQ in Sankt Mortiz, Switzerland, to ensure\u00a0that such a delicate and dangerous product is assembled in the safest\u00a0and most accurate way.\nYour help will ensure we can start a full production run for the cells, optimising cost and material waste, and guaranteeing a still long life to the Inspire 1 drone family!\nFor each battery you will send in for regeneration, we will discount 20\u20ac (TB47) or 30\u20ac(TB48) from the listing price; you can also directly buy regenerated TB47, as we have plenty of stock; TB48 will need to wait for the new cells production run, but every purchase of TB47 will also contribute to the funding!\nShipping is calculated separately, but we encourage combining inbound and outbound shipments with your friends or colleagues to save on the cost.\nContact us at battery@heliengadin.com for more information about shipping and handling."

        "Text": "\n\n\n\n\nPeople are on the Move\nSome make seasonal migrations to feed themselves and their animals. Some are forced from their homes due to natural disasters or war. Others make their living traveling into dangerous territories. Others explore the harshest wilderness to invigorate their lives.\nOur studies, commencing five years ago, determined that today's people-on-the-move require rugged, weatherproof, lightweight, long-life, wearable tools that can clean accessible surface water and continuously energize life-saving gear, like water pumps, area lighting, heat sources, and communications equipment.\n1) Tools must enable users to operate independently of an electrical grid. \u00a0Users require \"availability.\" Those in unpredictable conditions don't have a \"reality pause button via which to take a break\" while a tool is maintained or recharged. Users must have operational and maintenance freedom and never be tethered to a proprietary battery or proprietary water filter. \u00a0\n2) Tools must generate a minimal amount of destructive waste.\u00a0\nOur Mission is to provide access to clean water, air and power, to those in need, due to war, migration, natural disaster, or pollution without dependence upon proprietary maintenance / replacement / consumable schemes.\nOur technology puts users in control.\nNow, we need your help.\nOur Goals\n\u00a0Goal 1. Design and build rugged, portable, high-capacity and productive gear that delivers clean power and user independence.\u00a0\u00a0\nA. Bring sustainable energy to those in need.\nOur mission is to help bring clean energy and clean water to those who need it most. Upon the sale of each 75 packs here in the U.S. we will send Jaguar technology to a family in need overseas.\u00a0\nEach time 75 SlingIt packs are sold, we will send:\u00a0\n\n1 SlingIt Portable Power System\n2 Smart Chargers\n1 12V-USB converters\n12 rechargeable, protected, 18650 Li-ion batteries\n1 rollable solar panel\n\nAfter its launch in December, we will begin providing CleanIt water filtration systems. Each time 75 CleanIt filtration packs are sold, we will send 1 CleanIt to a family in need.\n\n\n\n\n\nB. Eliminate needless battery waste.\nIt\u2019s not discussed a lot in public consumer forums but lithium-ion battery degradation and lithium-ion battery recycling are big challenges.\u00a0\nIts often published that high quality lithium-Ion batteries can be recharged and drained between 400 and 600 times before their capacity to store energy is degraded by about 20% or more. That\u2019s why, generally speaking, regularly recharged batteries only remain productive for 2 or 3 years.\nVarious publications, even those trying to put a positive spin on battery use, admit that (only) about 5% of lithium-ion batteries are recycled; because recycling the battery components is more costly than the value of the materials rendered from the process.\nOne scary estimate shows China alone generates about 500,000 metric tons of used Li-ion batteries each year and that by 2030, the worldwide number will hit 2 million metric tons per year.\nSo where do 95% of these waste batteries and their associated poisons end up? They end up dumped in nature or in landfills, most likely.\nThe SlingIt is designed to reduce battery waste by empowering users to identify individual degraded or failing batteries, and then, selectively and responsibly, dispose of those individual batteries.\nTraditional \u201cbattery pack\" designs are very different from SlingIt's design. Traditional designs lock all a pack's batteries together in a proprietary plastic housing. \u00a0Batteries are wired or spot welded together. \u00a0Traditional designs turn the entire pack into a \u201cconsumable\" product, only productive so long as its batteries are productive. Just 1 degraded battery in a pack can severely degrade overall pack performance. End users are unable to selectively use (remaining) good batteries in the pack after the pack has failed. \u00a0The designs increase the complexity and cost of recycling.\nSlingIt's design puts the power to responsibly manage and dispose of batteries into your capable hands.\nC. Minimize manufacturing waste via US-based manufacturing on demand.\u00a0\nWe rejected cost reduction methods dependent upon mass manufacturing, which is wasteful and slows the deployment of incremental product component improvements.\u00a0\n\nJaguar products are assembled on demand. \u00a0Product components, designed by the team, are fabricated in small batches as units are ordered.\nWe begin the process of building your system upon its purchase.\u00a0\nWe transport scrap copper, aluminum, and polyethylene pieces to recyclers.\n\nJaguar Wearable Technologies is located in U.S.\nThe SlingIt hardware components we design are fabricated in the U.S.\nAll our SlingIts are assembled by the Jaguar team, by hand, in the U.S.\n\nEvery SlingIT is tested after assembly. \u00a0Every SlingIT receives a unique serial number and every part version used to build each SlingIT is cataloged to improve service if ever you need support.\n\n\u00a0Goal 2. \u00a0Design and build rugged, portable, and productive gear that delivers premium water filtration performance and user independence.\u00a0\nIn December the Jaguar team will release CleanIt.\nCleanIt electrically pumps and filters water. It is dimensionally compatible with SlingIt. CleanIt can be powered by SlingIt or another 12 volt, 10 amp, DC power source and standard 12-volt socket.\nCleanIt will possess all of SlingIts, rugged, lightweight and long-life characteristics. \u00a0\nLike SlingIt, users will be empowered to operate independently of proprietary maintenance and consumables. \u00a0Of course, users will be able to purchase filtration packets from Jaguar, but we will publish filter packet materials and assembly methods so users can build their filtration packets.\nCleanIt will sell for about $1199.00. Units will begin shipping in January.\nAbout Us\n\n\n\n(Left to Right) Sean Anderson, Co-Founder; Mackenzie Anderson, Co-Founder; Ricky Livingston, Co-Founder \n\n\nPresently there are 7 Jaguar team members. Members have worked for IBM, HP, Xerox, and the United States Air Force, among other organizations. We are a small, self-funded team of scientists, engineers, and manufacturing experts founded upon the belief that our time is best spent building gear that enables personal refuge and exploration within extremely harsh environments.\nWe have been studying the problems, exploring alternative solutions, building and testing prototypes, and refining plans for 5 years. \u00a0\nWe are in it for the long haul.\nOur team members primarily reside in Southern California. \u00a0Presently we assemble all of our gear in Southern California. In the future, we hope to fabricate parts and assemble systems throughout the United States.\nWe have all been working full-time and/or part-time (at other companies) to pay for our own materials, fabrication, and testing. We all want to commit ourselves full-time to designing/manufacturing our gear, and doing the fieldwork required to evolve our solutions, while developing new ones.\nNote: We shot and edited our videos ourselves but hired spokes people to deliver some of our key ideas because none of us are presentation professionals. Thank you for your understanding.\nOur personal financial resources are not adequate to bring our gear to market. \u00a0We need a kickstart to staff and equip a:\n\nModest manufacturing center\nCustomer service team\nSales/marketing team\n\nPlease provide your assistance, via a purchase, so we can bring our gear to the world.\n\u00a0Jaguar is pleased to introduce SlingIt.\u00a0\n\n\n\nRecharge your batteries using smart chargers. Load charged batteries into SlingIt. Activate SlingIt. Once you\u2019ve used all the power, empty SlingIt of drained batteries and load fresh batteries.\nTake a look!\n\n\n\nSlingIt is more than portable; SlingIt is wearable. Check out our unique storage design and how to wear your SlingIt here:\n\n\n\nSlingIt; when loaded with just 6, readily-available, standard-size, rechargeable, lithium-ion batteries, transforms into a dependable power source.

It runs on standard-size, rechargeable batteries. Just swap out drained batteries with charged batteries in minutes\nSlingIt is powered by SIX standard-sized, 5, 8 or 10 amp, rechargeable, lithium-ion, 18650 batteries. Many battery manufacturers consistently produce high-quality 18650 cells, including Panasonic, Samsung, Sanyo, and Tenergy. You find them all over the world in electric cars, electric bikes, power tools, flashlights, and battery packs. Keep spare, charged batteries on-hand. When batteries are drained, simply swap them out with recharged batteries and keep using your SlingIt.\nStandard size 18650 rechargeable batteries typically advertise capacities between 2500 and 3500 milliamp hours (mAh). You load six of the same 18650 batteries into a SlingIt to generate 12 volts and up to 10 amps of power. When the system can\u2019t deliver 12 volts via the power provided by the batteries, SlingIt shuts down the power to its 12 volt socket. When the power shuts down, swap out the drained batteries with charged batteries. Insert the drained batteries into smart chargers and they will tell you if any of the individual batteries are degraded or failing.\u00a0\nSafely and responsibly discard any bad batteries.\u00a0\nYour supply of spare, optimally operating batteries, will maintain peak SlingIt performance. Using SlingIt, battery degradation problems are resolved, not masked, as they are in conventional battery pack designs.\nWhy are we willing to let you quickly replace drained batteries with charged batteries rather then taking the pack off line to accommodate hours of pack recharging via \"plug?\" Why do we enable you to detect and replace degraded batteries? Because we are not in the business of selling batteries, whether or not those batteries are packed into packs. It\u2019s not our goal to sell you multiple packs, so you can overcome hours long recharge times or overcome degraded pack performance.\nWe consider it our job to enable you to build a spare battery and smart charger supply that best meets your needs according to your own budget. We consider it our job to ensure you are free to have safe access to power almost anywhere and almost anytime.\nYour SlingIt will arrive with 12 batteries and two battery smart-chargers as a free gift.\nAs mentioned above, via just six batteries....\n\nSix 3500 mAh batteries energized a WOW 2160 lumen LED work light for over 3 hours.\nSix 3500 mAh batteries recharged a lower capacity internal mobile phone battery 7x (from 0% to 100%).\nSix 3500 mAh batteries energized 1 of the water pumps we intend to deploy in our CleanIt water filtration system for over 5 hours.\n\nNot bad for less than 12 ounces of battery weight.\n\n\n\n2) Keep track of your battery performance using readily available smart chargers.\nYou never recharge batteries in a SlingIt. \u00a0Charging individual batteries via a smart charger is much more efficient than charging a big battery pack. Smart chargers identify degraded or failing batteries so you can remove them from your battery inventory to preserve peak SlingIt performance.\nYou can read more about battery degradation on our web site.\u00a0\nWhy Battery Degradation is a Key Challenge of Traditional Battery Pack Design\u00a0\n\n\n\n3) SlingIt is impact-resistant and has no fragile displays or external switches.\nSlingIt doesn\u2019t look like typical power packs, because it\u2019s built to survive and remain functional through whatever rough conditions are served up during your journeys.\nSlingIt's internal, shock-absorbing battery suspension system is housed within a protective, 2.75\" diameter, 6061-T6 aluminum cylinder with 1/4\" thick, primed, coated and waxed walls. SlingIt has no external switches or displays susceptible to contamination or breakage.\n\n\n\n4) SlingIt is lightweight and wearable.\nThe SlingIt power system is lightweight and is designed to be worn like a pack or a cross-body \u201csling\u201d bag. SlingIt is carried in a custom, padded, dual-layer, heavy canvas cylindrical bag, surrounded by 10 rows of MOLLE loops.\nMOLLE stands for \u201cModular Lightweight Load-Carrying Equipment\u201d; it is a common standard used by manufactures who build interconnecting packs and pouches. By weaving straps attached to MOLLE-compatible accessories through the bag's loops, you can construct your own custom pack solution. The bag's loop arrays are used to attach the bag's shoulder straps and enable you to adjust how your pack straddles your back.\nSlingIt Weight and Dimensions\n\nOverall weight of SlingIt (including its canvas carry bag): 12 pounds\nOverall length: 27.75 inches\nDiameter of power system's battery assembly: 2.5 inches\nOuter diameter of the aluminum cylindrical battery assembly encasement: 2.75 inches\nDiameter of power system\u2019s protective end caps: 4.0 inches\nInner diameter of the cylindrical, canvas carry bag: 4.0 inches\nOuter (uncompressed/uncinched) diameter of the (uncompressed / uncinched) carry bag: 5.25 inches\n\n\n\n\n5) SlingIt is weather-resistant.\nSlingIt has a single, standard size, 12 volt socket. The single socket is weather-resistant, as end caps protect the system from contamination. SlingIt has no delicate, leak-prone, displays or switches, which can be contaminated by water and soils. Applying a thin layer of non-conductive dielectric grease, to the battery assembly's disk shaped seals provides extra protection. SlingIt's bag is treated for water and stain resistance.\n\n\n\n6) SlingIt is made from premium materials.\nSlingIt is designed to have a long life and is primarily made from:\n\n110 Copper\n6061-T6 and 7075-T651 Aluminum\nUltra-high molecular weight polyethylene.\n\nSlingIt is easy to maintain and, after a long life, recycle.\n\n7) Jaguar sustainably builds products in the USA.\nJaguar team members have directed manufacturing efforts for 30+ years. We understand when automation is required and when a human touch is preferable.\nAs mentioned above, we rejected cost reduction methods dependent upon mass manufacturing, which is wasteful and slows the deployment of incremental product component improvements.\u00a0\nJaguar products are assembled on demand. \u00a0Product components, designed by the team, are fabricated in small batches as units are ordered.\nWe begin the process of building your system upon its purchase.\u00a0\nWe transport scrap copper, aluminum, and polyethylene pieces to recyclers.\n\nJaguar Wearable Technologies is located in U.S.\nThe SlingIt hardware components we design are fabricated in the U.S.\nAll our SlingIts are assembled by the Jaguar team, by hand, in the U.S.\n\nEvery SlingIt is tested after assembly. \u00a0Every SlingIt receives a unique serial number and every part version used to build each SlingIt is cataloged to improve service if ever you need support.\n\n\u00a0Remember, CleanIt is Coming Soon.\u00a0\n\nCleanIt is a portable, electrically pumped, water filtration solution.\nCleanIt will be dimensionally compatible with SlingIt. CleanIt can be powered by SlingIt or another 12 volt, 10 amp DC power source and standard socket.\nCleanIt will sell for about $1199.00. You will be able to pre-order CleanIt in December and units will begin shipping in January.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Jaguar Wearable Technologies\u2019 Limited Product Warranty\u00a0\nWe are responsible for SlingIt\u2019s materials and manufacturing. We will repair or replace your SlingIt\u2019s components due to materials or manufacturing flaws up to one year from date of purchase, so long as you use your SlingIt in accordance with SlingIt\u2019s operating instructions. We are not responsible for damage resulting from misuse.\nWe give you the freedom to select your own 18650 batteries. It is up to you to use the batteries safely and responsibly.\nJAGUAR WEARABLE TECHNOLOGIES DOES NOT MANUFACTURE, INTEGRATE, DISTRIBUTE, OR RE-SELL BATTERIES. WE DO NOT PROVIDE BATTERY WARRANTIES. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR BATTERY PERFORMANCE OR THE USE/MISUSE OF BATTERIES BY THE END-USER.\n\nWhere to Buy Batteries for your SlingIt\nYou can buy 18650 batteries and smart chargers online from online retailers. Good places to start include: liionwholesale.com, power.tenergy.com, IMRbatteries, and 18650batterystore.com. These sites include detailed battery specifications and safety information. Some dealers offer \u201cbulk\u201d discounts.\n\nWhen it comes to storing and using rechargeable Lithium Ion batteries, here are some notes you need to review carefully.\nSlingIt supports \u201cbutton-top\u201d batteries exclusively. Button top style batteries are like the C or D cell batteries you commonly use in flashlights.\nAlways use 5, 8, or 10 amp batteries in your SlingIt. Never insert a battery claiming to support greater than 10 amps into your SlingIt.\nPower your SlingIt using \u201cprotected\u201d 18650 batteries. Each protected battery has its own small circular circuit board installed in its tip. Protection circuits are installed by battery component integrators and dealers. This protection circuit protects the battery from overcharge, or over-discharge.\nAlways use standard-length, 65mm-67mm, 18650 batteries. Protected, button-top batteries add about 2mm to the overall length of an 18650 battery.\nAlways install 6 batteries made by the same company, and which have the same capacity and amperage specifications into your SlingIt. You may have an inventory of batteries built by different companies, with different capacities, and which support different amperages; so make certain you keep your batteries sorted so you only have 1 type of battery installed at any one time.\nAlways follow the battery manufacturer\u2019s/battery distributor\u2019s directions for safety and handling.\nProtected 18650 batteries from major US distributors include:\n\nProtected, 10 amp, Button-Top Sanyo from IMR Batteries\nREAD THIS: IMR Batteries Warning\n\nProtected, 8 amp, Button-Top Samsung from 18650 Battery Store\nREAD THIS: 18650 Battery Store Warnings\n\nProtected, 10 amp, Button-Top Orbtronics from Orbtronics\nREAD THIS: Orbtronics Battery Warnings\n\nProtected, 10 amp, Button-Top LG MJ1 from Liion Wholesale\nREAD THIS: Liion Wholesale Battery Warnings (scroll to \u201cBATTERY WARNINGS\u201d toward the bottom of the page)\u00a0\n\n\u00a0READ THIS: University of Washington: Li-Ion Battery Safety (PDF file)\n\u00a0READ THIS: Panasonic Battery Warnings\n\n\nLithium-Ion battery ingredients and circuits are contained in metal cylinders wrapped in plastic skins. Never install a battery with a damaged skin into your SlingIt.\nUse 18650 batteries components made by reputable companies like Sanyo, Panasonic, Samsung and Tenergy; known for consistently delivering safe, high-performance products.\nUse smart chargers to safely recharge your batteries, identify degraded batteries and to identify faulty and failing batteries.\nSlingIt was brought to market, in part, to minimize battery waste streams. Please safely dispose of batteries and all e-waste responsibly.\n\nPlease Note: \u00a0During COVID lock downs, and now, following the (recent) end of lock downs, the highest capacity, protected, button top, name brand, 18650 batteries have been in short supply; but can be found among dealers with a bit of effort. Short supplies have led to slightly higher battery prices. If you can\u2019t find the highest capacity name brand batteries you desire, we recommend you purchase lower capacity, name brand batteries, and resist the temptation of purchasing off-brand batteries, which may be unsafe or provide inconsistent performance, and longevity."

With a 3D-printed resin lightweight handle that feels like it was made to be held by you, meanwhile, the handles look elegant and can be customized by yourself with your own 3D printer. X-ONE puts the power of every shave into your hands \u2013 with a DIY razor that you can assemble yourself and make your own.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut What\u2019s Wrong With Traditional Razors?\n\n\n\n\n\nMost conventional razors on the market today are built using aluminum alloy, and one of the biggest problems with that is that it\u2019s exceptionally uncomfortable to use in winter. It\u2019s heavy, it\u2019s cold, it\u2019s simply unpleasant. And you deserve better.\nThe X-ONE Difference\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re boldly steppe into your bathroom and transforming your shaving routine once and for all, with an advanced shaving innovation built from photosensitive resin. A hollow design is light in your hands, empowering you to groom and pamper in innovative style.\n\nA Revolutionary Grip\n\n\n\n\n\nWe know we said it already, but we can\u2019t reiterate it enough. You cannot truly comprehend the comfort and power of a photosensitive resin razor (built using the latest HALS polymer technology, which has peculiarity of high toughness and hardness) until you\u2019ve put it to the test yourself. And once you have, you\u2019ll never go back.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Perfect Shave Every Time\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile most conventional razors are heavy and leave you with itchy, unsightly razor burn, X-ONE features a ground-breaking 6-layer precision blade, leveraging advanced Sandvik technology produced in the heart of sweden. In fact, men just like you have confirmed with this razor can and will last 3 times longer than regular blades. A worthy investment? We think so!\n\n\n\n\n\nEach tri-blade set contains two blades a piece, with a fine 0.85 mm distance between each blade and 1.4 mm distance between each set \u2013 guaranteeing the most efficient and effective shave of your life.\n\n\n\n\n\nDesigned For Your Face\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery sweep of this bad boy feels like it was designed for your face. Everyone is unique, which is why we\u2019ve designed X-ONE\u2019s head to be 30\u00b0+10\u00b0. In other words: while the handle is fixed to 30\u00b0,the ergonomic head can be adjusted by 10\u00b0 depending on the shape and different parts of your face. This promises a unique and cleanest shaving experience you will not find anywhere else.\nSurprisingly Lightweight\n\n\n\n\n\nX-ONE packs in one hell of a punch for such a light razor. Its hollow design is based on humankind\u2019s natural grippe style, making it more comfortable and natural to use without feeling heavy in your hands.\nGrip With Comfort And Stability\n\n\n\n\n\nX-ONE will never slip and slide around when smothered in shaving foam. A comfortable yet firm grip keeps your razor right where it\u2019s supposed to be \u2013 firmly in your grasp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConvenient Magnetic Storage\n\n\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t know where to store your razor in-between shaves? Neither did we. Conquer the chaos in your bathroom with a magnetic handle and stand that keeps your X-ONE safely stored for next time while ensuring efficient water drainage that prevents bacterial growth. With advanced magnetic storage like this, you\u2019ll never be fumbling around to find your razor again. Perfect for those busy mornings when you need to clean up \u2013 fast. Moreover, any steel shelves can also be used to store the X-ONE, no matter standing or simply hang on it. In this way, the head will be even more hygiene.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Breeze to Clean\n\n\n\n\n\nCleaning X-ONE takes only a few seconds, so you can get on with your day. A quick rinse will remove any stains and germs in a flash, all thanks to its special array of blades.\n\nReplaceable Head\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s no need to buy a whole new razor if your current head is worse for wear. Simply pop it out in a snap with one single press, and replace it in moments. We recommend doing so every two month.\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY Handle\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX-ONE puts you in control of every shave. With a 3D-printed handle and all the data included, you can customize your style, color, and look and feel if you have your own 3D printer. We share all data for the head and connector so you can do your thing, and the material is compatible with most other materials on the market \u2013 from liquid photosensitive resin to ABS resin and beyond.\n\n\n\n\n\n(After the project is over, users who purchase X-ONE will contact us to provide the tracking number to obtain the print data of the X-ONE handle. You can also contact us by email: jiapeng.yu@ubunnys.com, we will provide you with after-sales and answers)\nX-ONE\u2019s data is compatible with 99% of FDM 3D printers out there \u2013 including creality \u00a03D, Aurora 3D, and Raise 3D.\nX-one 3D printing razor uses the innovative new material plasto 1000, a resin with high elongation and excellent flexibility, and has special treatment on the surface.

Even the slightest changes in our temperature can allow us to make informed choices such as whether we have to socially distance. \u00a0Although we may not need a thermometer everywhere we go, do you readily have access to one when you need it? \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the HIITCHECK, you only need 1 second. We understand that speed may not be a priority for most cases, but if an emergency arises, HIITCHECK will be there to give you the information you need as fast as possible.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHiiTCHECK focused on development for two years to resolve consumers' distrust of existing non-contact thermometers especially when it comes to temperature measurement accuracy.\nResearch and development was carried out to obtain a high-accuracy body temperature value by blocking the product's own heat and readings of non-relevant external temperature. Finally, after three rounds of product development, we were able to create the perfect infrared sensor that drastically minimized the margin of error. Now, we would like to present this technology to our Kickstarter backers before we fully release this to the general public.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Most consumer-grade thermometers have large margins of error because they do not take into consideration the specific emissivity value of human skin. Therefore, accuracy of results will vary when using a single generic device to measure the temperature of variety of things.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0HIITCHECK has maximized its accuracy and minimized the margin of error by developing a measurement algorithm that specifically takes human skin emissivity into account while measuring body temperature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe blackbody is \u00a0high-precision calibrator for the calibration of infrared thermometers. For the verification of medical thermometers, the temperature must be verified by a blackbody.

When the temperature sensor is out of range, HIITCHECK will send an alarm via vibration to notify the user to move closer or further away.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE FDA recommends when using non-contact infrared thermometers to measure either the forehead, temples, or behind the ears. HIITCHECK should not be used to measure body temperature via wrist readings, but if necessary, should be used on blood-flowing arteries.\n\n\n\n\n\nHiiTCHECK APP INCLUDED\u00a0\n\nAutomatically records body temperature, daily body temperature trend graph, daily/weekly/monthly body temperature trend analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecord symptoms, body temperature check alarm, connect to Google Maps, find a nearby hospital, find a nearby pharmacy, record body temperature by location, mode for women (record menstrual cycle, record symptoms, track ovulation through body temperature information), issue code and share temperature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you know that everyone has a different average body temperature?\nWith the HiiTCHECK thermometer, you can check the trend of your body temperature, and analyze the patterns to proactively maintain a healthy condition.\nUp to 5 guardians can automatically receive and share the records of one HiiTCHECK user.

We're a new branch of carpooling devoted to expanding reliable transportation and making it safe and secure with a free-to-download mobile platform. Our platform is built on my co-founders' and my vision to make ridesharing accessible and enjoyable for users in all U.S. municipalities. Ridesharing in its current state is virtually featureless for enhancing the safety or enjoyability of a user's trip experience. Unfortunately, it has prevented many from reaching their destination peacefully. We want to eliminate awkward interactions among drivers and riders and bring users together based on what they have in common. Each trip on our platform is conducted by matching users by the compatibility of their profiles made up of their \u00a0interests and trip preferences. That's only scratching the surface of what we offer though. We've also created a model that maximizes the earnings for drivers and eliminates excessive fees and price surges for riders. We can also guarantee the safety of our rides will be far superior to our competitors by using groundbreaking technology to provide live route monitoring, user authentication, and immediate emergency service access. Check out our website www.poolrides.com to learn more. If you're interested, but don't want to pay anything (yet), that's okay! You can still apply for our waitlist on our \"Sign Up\" page to receive updates and be notified of when our app releases!"

On the new Smart Hub with DockOS, you can also choose the working mode of different interfaces, customize the working parameters, etc. to realize human-machine interaction. The DockOS is upgradable to make it compatible with more devices.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe newly added D-Key button is used for DockOS system operation to bring a more user-friendly experience, which is more convenient for personalized use and parameter settings than the previous pinhole.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0The previous Visual Dock used traditional heat insulation methods to prevent the internal temperature of the chip from being conducted to the outside as much as possible, which may cause loss of the internal chip after a long time of use. The new Smart Hub has a built-in full-chip cooling system and is equipped with a high-performance silent fan, which can preset different values to turn on the heat dissipation to ensure stable work.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe product size upgrade brings a larger screen, you can read data more easily and clearly.\n\n\n\n\n\nCompared with the previous Visual Dock(7 in 1), two USB 3.2 ports are added to meet the people's demand for USB-A ports on the new Smart Hub. Meanwhile, as customer demand for USB-C port increases, we upgrade the card reader slot to a data USB-C port to take care of both card reader and other USB-C port equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne button, multiple identities. D-Key, which allows you to control various functions, switch operation modes and rotate the screen intelligently to adapt to different working scenarios.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo longer worry about the visual experience. The innovation of HDMI technology brings a revolutionary change, two switchable HDMI modes redefines how real 4K@60Hz can be.\nThe DockCase Smart Hub can convert 4K@30Hz host to 4K@60Hz output in the Extreme Mode, which the 4K@60Hz compatibility improved by 92% compared with traditional hubs, bringing you a smooth and extreme HD experience.\nYou can also choose the Balance Mode to realize the coexistence of 4K@60Hz and 10Gbps USB data transmission. In addition, 0-8 signal levels are available to stabilize HDMI output when screen flicking, black screen or other situations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOccupied Power of Hub: 5-25W can be selected to adapt to different power requirements, 5W can make the computer charge at the fastest speed (95W), and 25W can be connected to high-power devices such as external HDD and portable SSD. The built-in 24V CC high voltage protection protects the motherboard from burnt out, \u00a0so you can use it with confidence.\nWhat's more, the NS-Switch option allows you to enjoy an immersive experience whenever you want to play games on a bigger screen.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive stable data USB ports including the data USB-C port are adequate to the simultaneous use of multiple peripherals. Three USB3.2 Gen 2 ports transferring data at blazing speeds up to 10Gbps in no time.\nIt only takes 2 seconds to transfer a 2G movie in the High-Load Mode\uff0cEach data USB port can supply power up to 7.5W, which provides stable fast charging and data transmission at the same time.\nTwo additional USBA 2.0 ports make it easy to use traditional peripherals such as keyboard, mouse to save energy in the Eco Mode(the Eco Mode is available for subsequent upgrades).\n\n\n\n\n\nExclusive algorithm control, intelligent display of network connection speed. Gigabit Ethernet port supports 10/100/1000Mbps network speeds, which can provide a full play to the performance of the network, ensure connection instantly and smoothly for you to online gaming, working, video streaming, anywhere in a flash.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen using an ordinary hub, it is easy to heat up, which will cause unstable data transmission, performance degradation, even security risks, etc.\nWhen using the Smart Hub, you don't have to worry about these problems. The full-chip turbo cooling system equipped with a high-performance silent fan, 65-85\u2103 optional fan control allows the system to automatically start the fan to cool down to ensure that the internal temperature is within the safer range for healthy work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Upgradable firmware optimizes your Smart Hub continuously and is compatible with more devices.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOCKCASE has been paying attention to provide you with a more user-friendly experience so that you will always be in a beautiful mood every day!\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe detachable cable is convenient for you to change cables in different usage scenarios, and it also solves the problem that the hub cannot be used due to the damage of the cable, saving unnecessary expenses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe unibody design with the zinc alloy shield provides better protection for the internal components, and at the same time, you can feel the ultimate sleek and ice-cold texture when held in your hand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarter launches with 1,400+ successful Kickstarter projects and over $500M raised in total.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the backer fails to pay the customs clearance fee incurred in receiving the goods, resulting in the return of the goods, we will deduct it from the backer's crowdfunding amount.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following video demonstrated a fully functional pre-production DockCase Smart Hub with all ports working.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDockCase by Seesaw was founded in 2016 and by a team of excellent engineers and designers motivated by making the lives of USB-C device users easier and hassle-free.\u00a0\nWe have successfully launched three campaigns from August 2017 to January 2021, over 4,000 backers on Kickstarter were delivered.

        "Text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLove your cat, but hate the unpleasant routine - scooping? If you use a traditional cat litter box, you need to scoop at least once a day, and probably replace the plastic litter box itself at least once a year or wash the box thoroughly with detergent. And then on top of that there\u2019s the unavoidable dust, litter scattered everywhere, and smelly odor all the time.\nYou could go for a fully-automatic cat litter box, but those have to be placed close to the power supply, the noise of the machine may frighten your cat, and what\u2019s worse, you\u2019d be surprised at how many cats are actually die from mechanical failure of those fully-automatic litter boxes. Yikes! Luckily, Peterest has none of these problems and is here to save the day!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPull the handle, the rake will slide to scoop the waste into the waste receptacle beneath. Out of sight, out of smell.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether it\u2019s little poops or clumps of pee, the Peterest effortlessly scoops it with it\u2019s proprietary scooping systems, so you don\u2019t have to! No more scooping by hand.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeterest works with any kind of clumping litters such as clay litter, crystal litter, and more.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the Peterest, the smells and odors of your cat box are significantly reduced. You can place the box right in your front room and still not smell it because the smelly clumps are quickly scooped into a sealed container that keeps odor trapped.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe extra-large waste bin allows up to 7 days free of scooping for one cat\u200b. Moreover, Peterest offers a spacious interior with the capacity for cats of all weights and ages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best thing about Peterest is the whole process is contact free. All wastes and odors are segregated within the small container, so you don\u2019t have to touch it or scoop it out yourself.\nEverything you hated about scooping and cleaning has been fixed with Peterest!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe litter box is deep enough so the waste doesn\u2019t stick to the bottom and there\u2019s plenty of room for your cat to maneuver around inside and do their business.\n\n\n\nIt filters bad odor, you breath in pure air.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnclosed design and replaceable charcoal filter accomplish odor control.\n\n\nEquipped with a enclosed design, Peterest can keep the litter inside, reduce litter loss and contain the odor.\u00a0\nAlong with a replaceable charcoal filter, the odor control system is reinforced and your cat is more pleasant to use the litter box.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rake combs through the litter removing all the clumps but still leaving the litter behind and raises to 3.5 inch to leak the litter. That means your litter lasts longer because you\u2019re not scooping all of it out with the poop and pee!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rake can be detached easily and cleaned thoroughly. It doesn\u2019t hold any odors or get stained in any way. Just a quick spray off with some water and it\u2019s completely clean and ready for action.\n\n\n\n\n\nEasily remove the top and dispose of the waste bin whenever you feel the need, and when you put every part back together, it keeps all the odors nicely contained in a mostly sealed environment. Besides, the detached bottom can be used as an open litter box and stacked for convenient transportation.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeterest tells you when it\u2019s time to scoop. The short plastic pole will pop up when your cat enters the box automatically. Then, you know it\u2019s time to scoop. You can press the pole back down after you\u2019ve completed the job to reset it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo electricity is needed. You can put Peterest anywhere.\n\n\nWhen it comes to litter boxes, electric (or fully-automatic) sounds good, but there are actually quite a few drawbacks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if your cat is big or small, Peterest is a great litter box where it can easily fit and do it\u2019s business without any troubles. Even if your cat is Savannah, Maine Coon or Highlander, it can stay in the box comfortably.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a transparent front window so you can always keep an eye on what\u2019s going on and see the level of the cat litter. But the other walls are not transparent so your cat can feel safe while it goes to the bathroom and also has some privacy.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the worst things about typical litter boxes is all the litter that gets scattered around the box. With Peterest, there is a built-in litter trap under the swinging door that catches most of the litter from your cat\u2019s paw as they exit the box.

Pets have become part of our family members. This also means that pets need to be taken care of like our family members. The owner will naturally take some responsibilities in daily care. The Peterest Team hopes to share the responsibilities with pet lovers, reduce work, make pet raising easier, and let every pet family have more time to enjoy the fun of life with pets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project is boosted by BackerCrew\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "Text": "Accession v2 (version 2) is a complete computer system designed with one purpose in mind; integrate new, innovative ideas and methods in cybersecurity relating to design, hardware and software to take a more aggressive stance against ransomwares and viruses.\nThe focus of this project is to build a prototype of Accession v2.\n\nWhat Innovative Ideas Will Accession v2 Use?\nAccession v2 is an all inclusive way of looking at security for your computer and network. It is a combined hardware and software solution designed with the following features:\n1. easy migration of your current system into Accession v2;\n2. makes your computer completely inaccessible when you are not using it;\n3. employs a philosophy of compartmentalization in computer, hardware and software design;\n4. integrates a multitude of security software;\n5. contains double encrypted partitions on all storage devices;\n6. multiple backup, data recovery and remediation systems;\n7. uses the weapons a hacker employs against them;\n8. utilizes a USB \"key\" to run the entire system;\n9. compartmentalization of data, software and hardware.\nNone of these may seem \u201crevolutionary\u201d, but how we use them is.\n\nWhy Have All These Security Features?\nWhy integrate all these security features into one computer? To answer that, let\u2019s look at the weaknesses of current cybersecurity philosophy and computers in general and how Accession v2 solves them.\n\n1. Centralized Protection and Detection of Endpoints\nUsing a centralized IDS (Intrusion Detection System) to protect the endpoints (end-user computers) actually removes protection away from the main point of attack, which is the endpoints. Why not have each endpoint monitor, protect and recover itself? Accession v2 accomplishes this with integrated software all run by a separate operating system, giving the illusion of multiple centralized IDS systems to confuse and deter would-be hackers while still protecting the main points of attack.\n\n2. Standard Structure of Computers\nAll computers, whether PCs or MACs, follow the same basic structure. A main hard drive for storage of data with services running to operate that computer. This is like a maze where you already know the correct path to take. It\u2019s basically pointing hackers to where your sensitive data is stored. Accession v2 compartmentalizes the entire system, hardware and software, to change the maze up, creating confusion because your data is not where it\u2019s supposed to be.\n\n3. Standardized Recovery Systems\nHaving standard, centralized recovery and backup systems makes it easier for hackers to find and encrypt or even delete your backups. And by having a centralized backup, it gives the hackers one target to hit, which is much easier than the several targets created by Accession v2 due to the separation of their multiple backups and each endpoint within the network having the ability to recover itself.\n\n4. The Current Focus in Cybersecurity Philosophy\nThe current philosophy in cybersecurity methods is to focus on the unknown. WHAT could the next breach be? WHAT will the next vulnerability or exploit be? WHAT new method of infiltration will hackers use? Why? Why focus on the guessing game. This is a REACTIVE posture and causes the industry to play catch up. A new breach happens, the industry races to patch it. Another new breach happens, the industry races to patch that, and so on and so on. Let\u2019s focus on what we KNOW a ransomware does, instead of GUESSING what it will do. We KNOW a ransomware encrypts your data. We KNOW some ransomwares delete your data. We KNOW some ransomwares steal your data. By focusing on the KNOWN instead of the UNKNOWN, this creates a posture of ACTION instead of REACTION. Accession v2 accomplishes this by focusing on remediation of your encrypted or deleted data and wields tools to prevent your data from being stolen.\n\nCompartmentalization\nCompartmentalization- the division of something into sections or categories. Also a military term for separating the details of an operation between operatives to prevent the entire operation from being compromised if any one operative is captured.\nThis is the philosophy behind Accession v2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Does Accession v2 Compartmentalize Hardware to Protect a Computer?\nAt the core of Accession v2 is a USB flash drive that it uses as a \"key\". This flash drive houses RiseOS, our own operating system that runs the entire computer. When this \"key\" is removed, it \"bricks\" the computer, making your data completely inaccessible as there is no operating system to hack. This flash drive will also be the \u201ckey\u201d to accessing OmniscentOS, our specially designed operating system that contains the multitude of security software to protect the system as well as detect any breaches or intrusions. In addition, the basic structureof Accession v2 starts with two separate encrypted solid state drives with multiple partitions to store specialized operating system files (not actual operating system files) and the data from the two separate remediation systems.\nImagine being able to physically secure your computer in something as simple as a lock box when your work day is over. Accession v2 allows you to do this and more. These \"keys\" can even be assigned to employees if multiple people use the same computer, further increasing security and control of your network. This \u201ckey\u201d can also be used as a killswitch for the system, stopping the spread of a dangerous ransomware in its tracks.\nThis USB \u201ckey\u201d will also contain EpioneOS, named after the Greek goddess of healing, a third operating system designed specifically for data recovery, repair and remediation on Accession v2 that can be booted to instead of RiseOS as a last line of defense. EpioneOS will also be completely hidden from RiseOS and all other operating systems working within it, making it virtually invisible to any viral or ransomware attack.\n\nHow Does Accession v2 Compartmentalize Software to Protect a Computer?\nAccession v2 doesn't rely only on its unique structure for security, it will contain software solutions to help protect your data. This includes encryption on all hard drives, primary and secondary remediation systems to recover your entire computer in the event of a catastrophic viral infection (including ransomwares!) or other disastrous failure, such as a system crash. Accesssion v2 also contains OmniscentOS, a secondary operating system within RiseOS, that includes real-time monitoring, intrusion detection, wireless intrusion detection, file integrity monitoring and other security software. All these features are separated between RiseOS and OmniscentOS, so if one operating system fails, you can still remediate Accession v2 through the other. And, as mentioned above, Accession v2 will also have EpioneOS that can be booted to separately, just in case everything else fails.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou Mentioned Easy Migration?\nAccession v2 will have the ability to not only run RiseOS and OmniscentOS, but another operating system that can be a migration of your current Windows\u00ae system, or a fresh installation, all simultaneously. This migration process, housed on the USB \u201ckey\u201d, has been designed to be as easy and stress free as possible. This means your current computer, programs AND data can all be transferred into Accession v2 with no loss of functionality.\nAll this compartmentalization combined with your data separated between multiple encrypted physical locations, which are only accessible through the USB \"key\", decreases the chances of any of your data becoming compromised.\n\nDidn\u2019t We Say Something About Using a Hacker\u2019s Tools Against Them?\nYes we did. Why should a virus only be detrimental to a system? Can a virus protect your data as well? Yes it can. Accession v2 will employ a triggered virus that will destroy your data to prevent it from being stolen if a breach is detected. There is nothing to worry about though, as within RiseOS and OmniscentOS, there are primary and secondary remediation systems to recover your data within Accession v2 after the threat is over!\n\nThe Project As It Sits Now\nAs of the writing of this project, we currently have two \"working models\" of Accession v2 (NEITHER is an actual prototype, as these \"working models\" are not built using the planned form factor, CPU, RAM or hard drive specifications of the actual proposed prototype system, however, RiseOS is installed on, and working from, a USB flash drive on both \"working models\"). These \"working models\" were built so we could begin the coding and building of the operating system and additional security features, and to start preliminary testing. The images above contain actual screenshots of RiseOS. We added the monitor to make it look fancy. We have secured a vendor, and contacted numerous others, to manufacture the prototype computer (without the operating system) and the finished systems.\nRiseOS is 90% complete as of this writing. It is based on another operating system, SanctumOS, we created for another solution, SanctumNE, offered by Archai Solutions, LLC, so the basics are already in place, what is remaining to complete is additional in-depth coding to enhance the security software and remediation systems and to tighten up the look and feel of the operating system to make it more familiar and user-friendly. We are also developing a simpler graphical interface for unlocking the encrypted drives. OmniscentOS is about 50% complete, with the virus \u201cbooby trap\u201d still under development. EpioneOS is almost complete as well, due to it\u2019s singular focus, it has been the easiest to code.\nThe \"working models\" of Accession v2 have gone through preliminary testing of the primary and secondary remediation systems against ransomware infections; specifically Petya, NotPetya, WannaCry and Ryuk. We believed this was essential to complete as soon as possible as this is a primary feature of Accession v2. These remediation plans have been used successfully on other solutions offered by Archai Solutions, LLC, but not with this complex of a design. They have performed admirably in all preliminary tests and recovered 100% from each infection. The recovery process took between 32 and 53 minutes depending on the infection and whether it was the primary or secondary remediation system. We project that the actual prototype recovery time will be quicker due to the higher proposed hardware specifications. Below is a screen capture of a ransomware infection on Accession v2 and the recovery process through the primary remediation system. This video has been edited ONLY for time constraints. We don't believe ANYONE wants to sit through a 53-minute video of a bar slowly moving across the screen, although we will make the complete, unedited video available to any backer who wishes to see it. The secondary remediation system does take the computer out of the operating system, so doing a screen capture of this remediation system will be a little difficult. This secondary remediation system is planned only to be used as a last ditch recovery system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlans for Funding\nThe funds we are raising will be used for the following:\n- \u00a0The materials for, and construction of, an actual prototype system, this includes all the proposed hardware (i.e. form factor shell, CPU, motherboard, RAM, hard drives and USB drive);\n- \u00a0The hiring of one or two additional employees for additional coding, both controlled-environment and \"real world\" testing, and other responsibilities;\n- \u00a0The filing of a provisional patent and of the actual patent once Accession v2 is completed;\n- \u00a0Expenses associated with testing Accession v2 in a \"real world\" business environment. This includes the cost of commonly used business software such as Quickbooks, MySQL, CRM software, etc. to ensure Accession v2 does not inhibit any such software;\n- \u00a0Expenses associated with testing Accession v2 within different business network structures. This includes, but is not limited to, virtual servers, VPNs, networked drives, NAS systems, cloud storage, cloud computing, etc.;\n- \u00a0The writing, editing and printing of a \"quick start\" user's manual and the creation of a troubleshooting website;\n- \u00a0An additional \"slush\" fund for unexpected expenses. We have tried to take into account any and all expenses associated with this project, but as any creator or developer will tell you, there is always something unexpected that appears.\n\nThe Team\nWe are not new to technology. Our team has a combined 60 years working with, building and designing computers, hardware and software. We are fully versed in multiple forms of coding for Windows and Linux. The principle architects of Accesssion are:\n\n\n\n\n\nJosh Van Metre, Owner and Chief Innovation Officer\nJosh started his own computer repair and service company, Trust Tech Management in 2015 geared towards providing honest, inexpensive and quality computer services for small businesses and residential users. Realizing there was a need for innovative cybersecurity solutions for businesses, he started Archai Solutions, LLC (www.archaisolutions.com) unofficially in 2020 and officially in 2021, absorbing Trust Tech Management in the process, with the philosophy that standard cybersecurity techniques were not working and new, revolutionary solutions were needed. If the accepted solutions were enough, hackers and ransomware attacks would still not be the threat they are.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeah Streepy, Director of Client Services\nLeah is relatively new to the technology and cybersecurity industry, joining Archai Solutions, LLC in 2020 as Director of Client Services, but her enthusiasm, intelligence, drive and refreshing ideas have been indispensable to the development of this project. \u201cTechie\u201d people have a tendency to forget that not everyone has their level of knowledge and Leah\u2019s wealth of experience with clients and marketing has kept this project grounded and focused on the ease-of-use feature that is vital for this system."

I had originally created this invention it was supposed to be a push button motor that used batteries or plugged into your wall. It also used a gravity fed soap distributor and had a water line attached to the side. Part of me wanted to release this product but I thought what\u2019s more eco-friendly, one product that uses electricity or something that doesn\u2019t consume electricity and can be used thousands of times before it breaks down. (Plastic breaks down over the course of several hundred years.) I went with this eco-friendly idea because deep down inside I am a tree hugger at heart, I want future generations to have a life as good as previous generations. (I develop these types of products to make everyone life better.) Back when I was a kid, I was always stuck cleaning the dishes at my house and I always thought that there's got to be a more efficient way to clean cups. Fast forward to the present day, I learned about gears and gear ratios, and I decided to combine both a brush and a gear-based object and behold now we have the countertop spin brush was born.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight now, this is a functional prototype (as you can see it spins properly), the only difference between this and the final product is that right now I have the wrong spring installed as of right now.

I made it so the chocolate is visually on the sink so you can see how much chocolate it actually removed. When you go to use the spin brush you will want to place just next to the sink so that the food particles fall inside the sink.

Each time you pull the lever it should rotate 3 times. (because it is a 3 to 1 gear ratio)\n\nLet's say you have 20 cups*30 seconds=600 seconds to clean normally/60 seconds per min=means you waste 10 mins of your life every week. this is assuming you are cleaning 20 cups that day.\n\n3*20= 60 seconds\n6*20= 120 seconds\nIt depends on how many cups you produce every week, you could save a significant amount of time for people with large families.\n\nWho is this Product aimed toward?\n1). People who are prone to arthritis. Older people might not have enjoy turning their wrist while washing cups and my product is here to make their life easier.\n2). Households with large family\u2019s that go through many cups and your average household. (I don't want kids to waste their time scrubbing cups and this was one of the reasons why I invented this. They should spend less time washing cups and more time with their family.)\n3). Restaurants that use cups.\n\nWhat else can it be used on?\nProtein shaker bottles\n\nThis is how it works\nStep 1 Pick up the cup\nStep 2 Rinse the inside\u00a0\nStep 3 Pull lever 1-3 times (It took me about a second and a half in the video.)\nStep 4 ????\u00a0(Gears aren't magic, they are mechanical engineering, so it's not really a mystery by any means.)\nStep 5 Profit ?!? (Some people say time is money, so I'm here to help you save it. I like to think that your time is far more valuable than any amount of money in this world. The fact that life is so short makes time a very valuable commodity. )\nStep 6 Put the cup in the dish strainer/dishwasher.\n\nSafety Features\nThat square box=Prevents bodily damage by acting as a barrier between you and the gears. The box is rounded so that it won't cut the user.\nThere are no sharp external edges in my design, everything is smooth.\n\nOther Features\n\n\n\n1 There are 4 suction cups attached to the bottom of the spin brush. 2 The base has a carrying handle.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe base has pegs to hold the gears housing container.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gear housing container and base are notched to help seat the gear housing container better.\n\n\n\nThings that will change before product launch\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current spring size will be changed to make cup cleaning even easier.\nAfter recent feedback\nI have decided that I'm going with the quick release pin to the shaft so you can quickly swap between the cup brush and the bottle cleaner. (I realized that people would likely loose the lock pin and now that wont be a problem because the quick release pin will be a part of the shaft.)\n\n\nThings that might change before product launch\nThe delivery date may be earlier assuming i get help along the way, if not i am trying my best to get you your spin brush by next year. ill update you as much as i can if I'm successful.\n\n\n\n\nThe spring might attach in a fashion like this.  A hole in the gear lever and a hole in the base or the base could remain the same.\n\n\n\u00a0We will just have to wait and see what it will be like upon optimization.\n\nMultiple Versions\nIn the future i wanted to create multiple versions if this is successful.\nThe other versions\nThe second Version will be intended for a handicapped person. This version will hold the cup for them, it will use water along with its spinning ability.\nI want to get market validation for the first before I start advertising the second version and third versions.\nI want to make an alternate version where the plastic is recyclable(petg). Right now its not going to be made out of recyclable plastic because if it were recyclable then the plastic alone would cost 11$ and i cannot afford this i was making 20K 3 years ago and my pay check has only increased so much since then.\n\nWhat happens if its not successful?\nI guess I\u2019ll probably hang my prototype on a wall and stare at it. I think what really matters here is that I had the courage to leave my comfort zone and try advertise my product. With my current trajectory this idea was going nowhere fast. At the end of the day I think the only thing that matters is that I tried.\n\nWhile I\u2019m on the topic of my company named N\u00dcDDEN ill go ahead and post my company goals while I\u2019m here.\n\nI'm currently developing a phone based application. In the distant future may release an invention that would potentially help dispose of all the worlds plastic pollution.\u00a0One day I hope to release a video game similar to D&D."

Posts are intended to inform the user about an issue and/or show ways they can help. Posts are made by individuals, organizations (i.e. non-profits), and public sites (i.e. news, Go Fund Me, etc.) via RSS feeds. The opportunities to help span multiple avenues - advocacy, protesting, policy/petitions, donations, volunteering, etc. Doing so, makes collective impact more achievable. Additional features include: subscribing to verified users only, upvoting content, share options to other social media platforms, a rewards system to drive user engagement, and ability to filter to global and local content.\n\u00a0\nWhat problem is Reform trying to solve?\nThe missing intersection between information about current social and environmental issues and a diverse offering of solutions to address those issues. There\u2019s a knowledge gap across the United States about the issues many communities are experiencing today and why those issues are problematic. Secondly, there is not one cohesive platform that educates people on these issues while providing solutions that a population at varying income levels and ages can take action on. In order for change to happen, we must learn and take action in whatever capacity we can.\nWhat do I need funding for?\nI currently have wireframes and a video prototype for the app. I'm looking for funding to turn these wireframes into an app that can be found on the Apple app store! I have a qualified engineer ready to work on the development, all I need is help with funding.\n\nAny support is appreciated!! \u00a0"

        "Text": "2 Single-Digit Clocks with the Jubilant\nTwo single-digit clocks with neon lights for a laid-back lifestyle. Meet the largest and most elegant Nixie lamp in the world ever produced for the public!\u00a0\nIf you want to live a more relaxed life, you will love these clocks. They literally combine time and leisure.\n\nThe ZIN clock shares 2 vivid traces of Nixie technology. Nixie numerical indication technology makes very accurate counting and applies in space flights. \u00a0Also, beautiful Nixie neon discharge technology applies in light advertisements on shops and illuminations in Disneyland and Las Vegas.\n\n\n\nReady-made Nixie Tube\n\n\nWe believe that you can enjoy this beautiful indication technology more often.\nThe largest Nixie tube in the world:\n1. The gas is evacuated from the tube.\n2. A little but well-measured amount of neon or argon is infused in the tube.\n3. The tube represents a well-sealed bulb with electrodes coming out of its base, anode mesh and cathode filaments.\n4. When a voltage is applied to the two electrodes, the gas in the tube allows the current to flow.\n5. The digits light up and one can observe the plasma or gas discharge around the digits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct line of Clocks\n\n\nZIN clock is an art piece\n1. The glass and the mechanism of the clock have been elaborated with remarkably high precision.\n2. ZIN18 and ZIN70 Nixie clocks represent a new variety of IN and Z types of Nixie lamps. This contributes to historical Nixie tubes\u2019 development.\n3. ZIN70 clock has the largest ever Nixie tube in the world produced for the public. It more resembles Z-type tubes - z568m.\n4. ZIN18 clock has the most elegant Nixie tube. It is elongated and neat. It more resembles IN-type tubes - IN18.\n\n\n\n\n\nZIN clock for the house and laid-back lifestyle\nYou can place this clock on the shelf or the table of your living room, bedroom, or kitchen.\nApart from showing the time in an easy format, it will brighten any room and make it more vivid.\n\n\n\n\n\nSingle-digit neon clock for chalet cabin and beach house.\nNothing will bring more style, history, and laid-back air into the room as this one-digit neon lights clock. It is perfect for the houses where you go to recover your energy. Looking at this clock sometimes feels like looking at a fireplace. In the mountains, in the forest, by the ocean or the lake, it shows the time in natural[EL2] \u00a0lights of electric current.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingle-digit neon clock for creative workshops\nThis clock fits well in creative workshops and studios for artists, writers, photographers, and sculptures. It is also the best for scientists and researchers. In general, you will enjoy it if time is not a constraint in your work. This clock does not give you extra information, it is not pressing, and it is creative.\n\n\n\n\n\nZIN Nixie tube is almost eternal\nThe ZIN Nixie lamp is made of stainless steel. We annealed the glass of the lamp to make it super strong. Also, we flawlessly crafted the mechanism of the tube. The envelope of the lamp is securely sealed. It is only the aging of the components that can impact its functioning. That is why the lamp\u2019s service life is unlimited.\n\n\n\nIn the office\n\n\nTime synchronization\nFor time counting, this ZIN clock uses an HV5622 micro scheme and displays one digit. The most fascinating fact lies in the most accurate numeric display technology not requested to be the most precise.\nThe ZIN clock has an alarm. You can set it for the morning or any other time. With this clock, you can always be on time and never miss your schedule.\nThe clock that only counts hours can also chime to announce each new hour. We created stylish chimes in diverse themes.\n\n\n\nRewards\n\n\nTweak ZIN clock\n\u25cf Tweak RGB of underlights\n\u25cf Tweak gradual switch of the digits\nIf you are a Nixie tubes enthusiast, you can use the ZIN70 lamp \u00a0instead of your z568m lamp on your own devices. You can easily disconnect the ZIN70 lamp from the clock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSlot machine\u201d for lamp protection\nThe clock, by default, protects \u201crelaxed\u201d filaments from the particles of active filaments. Once in a while, it flips through all the digits. This process is called a \u201cSlot machine.\u201d It successfully solves the issue of cathodes poisoning and protects the lamp.\nSupply voltage - 12V\nAverage consumption of current - 1A\nHighest consumption of current - 1A\nHighest power consumption - 14W\nInput voltage - 12V DC\n\n\n\n\n\nEasy setting\nThe setting up process of this clock is \u00a0extremely easy and intuitive. You can set the clock with the two press buttons that you can find on its base. You will need to follow the Table of settings that is given in the clock\u2019s User guide. First, you will need to select a parameter and then assign a value to it.\nThe ZIN70 and ZIN18 lamps can serve forever. They have \u0430 15- year \u00a0warranty. The\nelectronic part of the clock serves on average for 5 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the team\nWe are a small company that produces Nixie devices such as clocks, watches, and thermometers. We love beautiful and historical technologies that are gas discharge numerical indication. We want to make it more advanced, adapted, and affordable for the public. We have a new laboratory with the most modern equipment for Nixie tubes production. There, we design and produce Nixie clocks. We are happy to have already had a successful experience in new Nixie clocks production.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject timeline\nWe discussed and planned all the project stages and are optimistic about being on time with all deliverables.\n\n\n\nProduct Stages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisks and challenges\nWe have been making Nixie lamps for a long time now and are quite sure of what we do. Even\nthough if any project\u2019s stage goes out of the schedule, we will inform you here on this campaign\npage. We will try to cope with any issues as soon as possible to get your rewards\nin time.\n\n\nGlobal Shipping\nWe happily offer shipping to anywhere in the world! The shipping rate to your country will be indicated in the check-out menu when pledging to this campaign. We've negotiated with international carriers - FedEx, UPS. That's the best price we can get with discounts. Please note that the price of the item does not include additional duty and taxes that may apply as per local laws of importation. If taxes and/or duties apply, we will contact you to accommodate your local laws.\nWe have been in the Nixie business since 2012.

This little keyboard has the potential to be the world's fastest keyboard. It uses a system called stenography which is a system of writing word by word through strokes and chords.\nIf you want to type faster, sure, you can practice Qwerty every day, or maybe learn a new keyboard layout such as Colemak, Dvorak, or Workman. But you are limited by the keyboard itself; you can only achieve so much with a keyboard that lets you type only one letter at a time. Qwerty was actually designed to slow you down to prevent jams in the typewriter machine!\nStenography is different. The system was developed with the sole intention of keeping up with the speed of human speech. The average person speaks at about 180 WPM and the average court reporter (people who use stenography to transcribe court proceedings) can type at 200 WPM easily for up to several hours.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nOrigin Story\nPrototype Uni v1:\nFebruary 2021: Green PCB without even a backplate. Fully functional, but could use some design upgrades.\nUni v2:\nMay 2021: Matte Black PCB with backplate compatibility.

        "Text": "*** This is the UPDATED Project for the Laser Lawnmower \u00ae . \u00a0We initially had started the project with a target of over $400,000.00; however, we had some freelancers whom were interested in the project. \u00a0We decided to go with these freelancers/consultants to have the prototype built.\nSince, we are going with these independent people, our goal has dropped and we wanted to share it with the public. \u00a0We are able to drop our funding goal and still get everything done. \u00a0***\nJ & M Inventions, LLC is a family owned business (father and daughter team), based out of Fargo, North Dakota, which focuses their attention on making people\u2019s lives safer and avoiding injuries and deaths. We are excited to bring this opportunity to the public and seek their support to SAVE LIVES.\nJames and Maria are reaching out to the public seeking funding for their invention. They have filed non-provisional patents with the USPTO for their invention along with trademark applications for the name.\nThey invented a new way to cut the grass, the \u201cLaser Lawnmower\u201d, and are seeking funding from the public.\nThey have contacted a large well-known company (we are unable to say which company due to signing a Non-Disclosure Agreement, NDA) and they have shown interest in the laser lawnmower; however, they are wanting a prototype and proof of concept. We are needing the money for the creation of a prototype.\nWe are confident once we have a prototype that there will be a deal and you will see this invention in a store near you.\nFor almost 100 years the lawnmower has not changed in design with its spinning metal blades.\nEach year, thousands of people in the United States go to the Emergency Room, due to lawnmower injuries and deaths.\nThis is costing Millions of dollars a year, just in injuries and deaths. Plus, several Millions in property damage from things being broken from items being kicked out from the spinning of the metal blades.\nPeople are injured and property is damaged from the spinning blades from a lawnmower. These blades kick out (from under the lawnmower), rocks and sticks at high rates of speed.\n\"We still see too many foot injuries from power lawnmowers,\" says foot and ankle surgeon James Thomas, DPM, FACFAS. \"The blades whirl at 3,000 revolutions per minute and produce three times the kinetic energy of a 357 handgun.\"\n\u201cAmerican Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons: \u201cThe energy transferred by a typical lawn mower blade is equivalent to being shot with a 357 magnum pistol.\u201d\nA study released in 2018 by researchers at Johns Hopkins Medicine found that lawn mower injuries, most of which require surgery, cost an average of $37,000 per patient. The study examined lawn-mower-related Emergency Room visits from 2006 to 2013.\nWe NEED your help to raise this money so we can help prevent injuries and deaths. PLEASE help us to help others. EVERY dollar gets us closer to the goal.\nThis lawnmower could prevent you or one of your loved ones from being injured or killed.\nGod Bless everyone who took the time to read this and for those generous few whom provided funding.\nTake care,\n\nFREQUENT ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)\n1. How do I know this is legit and not a scam?\na. We are a real company based out of Fargo, North Dakota, and registered with the North Dakota Secretary of State. This is real and NOT a scam.\n2. Who is the company that is interested in the invention?\na. We can not answer that question because when businesses enter into negotiations both sides want to keep the details a secret. It is a way to protect both parties, when there is a deal made, eventually it will be public knowledge, but once again the details will be secret.\n3. Will the Laser Lawnmower catch the grass on fire?\na. Most people will only cut their grass when it is healthy and growing, hence forth why they are cutting the grass. Healthy normal grass is made up of mostly water 70%- 85% water. There is no fear of it catching fire.\ni. Click on the link for more facts about lawns:\n1. https://www.mowmore.com/blogs/news/lawn-and-turfgrass-facts-and-stats\n2. https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/10/opinion/l-need-water-try-grass-468401.html\nb. There are some people whom would cut \u201cdry\u201d or \u201cdead\u201d grass. In theory, that could cause a fire hazard. With that said, we have made modifications and designs to the patent.\nc. *** We have added several water jets (found after the lasers have cut the grass) which will spray water onto the clippings to prevent any possibility of catching fire. This is an OPTION which can be turned off by the user. If they are cutting healthy grass there is no need to have the jets spraying on the clippings.\n4. Is the Laser Lawnmower really safe? What if I get cut by the Laser Lawnmower?\na. It is important to note that IF a person were to get their foot or fingers under the lawnmower deck, it will be cut off no matter if it was the metal blade or a laser.\nb. The BIG difference between getting cut be a laser and a metal blade is how the wound looks. From a medical point, it would be easier to attached a severed finger, toe, hand or other body part when it was cut off by a laser. A Laser will make a straight \u201cclean\u201d cut, which a medical surgeon will be able to attach it much easier.\nc. However, in the same situation of a body part being cut off by a metal blade, the wound would be different. The edges will be jagged and torn. It may or may notbe able to be attached as easily as a laser wound.\nd. Another issue is the infection possibility. The laser would NOT have any germs which would enter the wound when it is cut, because of the intense heat. Where as a metal blade would have grass, dirt, and germs on the blade.\ne. Another point will be that IF a person were to get their foot or hand under the deck of the lawnmower, the normal spinning metal blades covers the entire area under the deck of the lawnmower.\ni. But the small area for the lasers will be about 1 inch from the left side to the right side of the lawnmower deck. So, unless that person who accidentally went under at the exact point of the laser\u2019s they will not get injured.\nii. There is a 100% chance of a person getting injured from a spinning metal blade IF they get their body part under the lawnmower deck.\n\n\n\n\n\niii. There is a 10% chance of a person getting injured IF they get their body part under the lawnmower deck, because the lasers ONLY go from one side of the deck to the other side. There is 90% of the area which would be safe IF a person got under the lawnmower.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. How safe is it IF a person fell off while driving a riding lawnmower?\na. As you can see from the diagram a person who accidentally fell while riding on the riding lawnmower will have a less of chance of injury or death with the Laser Lawnmower than the spinning blade mower.\nb. It would be more likely a person whom fell (while sitting on a riding lawnmower) will miss the lasers, since the lasers are stationed further forward on the mower. While on a traditional spinning blade mower the person would 100% be injured by the spinning blades.\n6. How many lives will be saved by using the Laser Lawnmower?\na. 100%of the people (would be affected) whom would have been injured or killed by an object being thrown at them from the spinning blades. Laser lawnmowers do NOT have spinning blades.\n\n\n\n\n\nb. Roughly 80%-90% of people (would be affected) whom would have been injured or killed when they accidentally fell under the push or riding lawnmower, since the danger area of the lasers will greatly be reduced by 90%.\n7. How will the Laser Lawnmower save lives?\na. The Laser Lawnmower will NOT have any spinning blades which will kick out objects at the speed of a .357 magnum handgun. People will not be struck and harmed by any spinning blades.\n8. How many people are injured/killed from lawnmowers each year?\na. For those wondering about the REAL numbers of injuries from lawnmowers: Here are the facts from the Government website of CPSC.gov and the American Hospital Association aha.org.\nb. Here is the link to the NEISS Data Highlights for Calendar Year 2019: https://www.cpsc.gov/s3fs-public/2019-NEISS-data-highlights.pdf?ZU3YoE6xnBRIICuP8BvBRpsXMV7Tb9sg\nc. The report stated the following: \u201cThe 2019 NEISS estimates have been produced from a sample of 96 hospitals, including children's hospitals. Information from NEISS is available to the public through CPSC's National Injury Information Clearinghouse \u00a0(phone: 301-504-7921) and online at www.cpsc.gov/en/Research--Statistics/NEISS-Injury-Data/\u201c\nd. ***NOTE: This is an estimate of injuries from ONLY 96 hospitals.***\ne. On page 3 of the report, it reported 77,244 injuries from lawnmowers.\nf. Since, this report ONLY took a sample of 96 hospitals we must look at how many hospitals there are in the United States.\ng. Here is the link to the American Hospital Association: https://www.aha.org/statistics/fast-facts-us-hospitals\nh. As of 2021 there are a \u201cTotal Number of All U.S. Hospitals 6,090\u201d\ni. To get the rough estimate of injuries from lawnmowers per year FROM ALL HOSPITALS, we will use the estimate from the 2019 NEISS Report of 77,244 (From 96 hospitals).\nj. There are 6090 hospitals and divide that by 96.\nk. 6090 divided by 96 equals 63.\nl. IF we are to estimate how many lawnmower injuries there are in the entire United States, we will have to multiply the 2019 NEISS reported lawnmower injures of 77,244 by 63.\nm. That gives us an estimate of 4,866,372 injuries from lawnmowers from ALL United States Hospitals EACH YEAR.\n9. Will the Laser Lawnmower SAVE me MONEY?\na. YES! It will SAVE you MONEY!\nb. You will NOT have to buy spark plugs, gas, and air filters,\n10. Will the Laser Lawnmower SAVE me TIME?\na. YES! It will SAVE you TIME!\nb. You will NOT have to sharpen any metal blades before using the lawnmower.\nc. NO changing the oil.\nd. NO need to clean the air filter.\n11. Is the Laser Lawnmower healthy for my grass?\na. YES, IF you were to look at a blade of grass (under a microscope) after a metal blade cuts through the blade of grass, you will see a jagged edge.\nb. If a laser were to cut that same piece of grass the edge will be a \u201cclean\u201d straight cut. This is LESS traumatizing to the grass and will be healthier for the grass.\n12. Is the Laser Lawnmower environmentally friendly?\na. YES, it is environmentally friendly!\nb. NO need for oil.\nc. NO need for gas.\nd. NO pollution in the air from the engine.\nNews articles (all over the world) from people injured or killed by the spinning blades of lawnmowers.\n** These injuries and deaths could have been avoided IF a Laser Lawnmower was being used.**\nFROM UNITED KINGDOM\nhttps://metro.co.uk/2010/03/03/woman-decapitated-in-lawnmower-accident-143259/\nFROM IRELAND\nhttps://www.irishtimes.com/news/item-thrown-by-lawnmower-killed-man-1.199074\nFROM THE UNITED STATES\nhttps://www.foxnews.com/us/south-dakota-woman-survives-freak-lawn-mower-accident-that-left-her-neck-sliced-open\nhttps://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-2006-09-01-mbellybutton01-story.html (18-year-old)\nhttps://www.kansascity.com/news/nation-world/national/article254209068.html (6-year-old)\nhttps://www.kenoshanews.com/news/local/riverview-school-student-injured-by-lawnmower-projectile-flown-to-hospital/article_018b571f-ac68-50e3-92bb-198db97fa424.html (6-year-old)\nhttps://www.star-telegram.com/news/state/texas/article252453483.html\nhttps://nypost.com/2021/04/16/man-gets-metal-shard-propelled-into-eyelid-while-mowing-lawn/\nhttps://www.wisn.com/article/wisconsin-boy-in-coma-after-rock-kicked-lawn-mower-hit-him-in-head-recess/37613140# \u00a0(6-year-old with a brain injury)"

You will feel like you're in the same room with the musicians.\nStylish Minimalist Design With The Point\nEach enclosure has its advantages and disadvantages. We combine them to overcome their disadvantages and get the best of both worlds. The disadvantage of an open baffle is the reduced bass reproduction.

The perfect sound characteristics are completed by a subwoofer in minimalist body which is tuned for an authentic low end.\n\n\n\n\n\nHighly efficient transparent open baffle design with two aluminum cone 15 W speakers designed in the USA, delivers clean spacious highs and mids, along with a 30 W woofer in the rigid aluminum body for deep precise low-end.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen-baffle speakers\n\n\n\n\n\nWoofer in aluminum body\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the classy leather handle with stainless steel frame to take the speaker with you everywhere you go.

Press once for the lowest temperature and up to four times for the highest temperature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tested our coat out, this is what our customers had to say.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBattery Charger: We have added a pocket 3/4 of the way down the coat for the power pack. \u00a0Every coat comes with a FREE battery pack with universal adaptability.\n\n\n\n\n\nDetachable Bag: \u00a0The first Puffer Coat to feature a detachable bag with magnetic attachment to make it easy to put on. The bag is reversible, features two pockets on each side and has an adjustable strap.\n\n\n\n\n\nRemovable Sleeves: Zip off your sleeves for those not so chilly days and turn your coat into a vest.\n\n\n\n\n\nHandy Sleeve Pocket: We have added a convenient pocket on the sleeve to carry your cell phone, credit card, keys or whatever you want. \u00a0Easy to reach!\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Ear Pod Pocket: We have also added a neat little side pocket on the sleeve to hold your ear pod case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it came to chosing an artist to work with for this project we really wanted to collaborate with an Indigenous artist. \u00a0So after much searching we engaged Niketa Law a contemporary Aboriginal artist. Her inspiration for Barambah Winds came from her home in the Australian Hinterland and has been created exclusively for us.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Hi, my name is Beverley and I am the Founder of Consequence of Change. \u00a0We are a small but mighty brand. \u00a0Our purpose is to support the arts with our art collaborations. \u00a0We commission each piece of work to ensure the artist \u00a0is paid fairly. We also do this so that our customer has something truly unique. \u00a0\nWe are small batch so only offer very limited numbers due to the costs and also wanting to keep our products one of a kind. \u00a0This coat has been my dream since visiting Iceland and my Puffer Coat just did not do it's job. \u00a0So by supporting \u00a0us you are going to receive something truly special.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is really important that you follow our recommendation on how to choose the right size for you:\nAs you are going to be measuring for a coat we recommend taking your measurements over your regular clothes. \u00a0\nChest measurement: \u00a0The chest is the most important body part for coat measurements. \u00a0Stand up straight, relax your arms at your side. \u00a0Ideally ask someone to help - wrap the tape measure around your chest area making sure the tape measure has some room (max 1\"/2.54cm) to move. \u00a0If you want the jacket to fit looser you should add an additional inch/cm. \u00a0Measure horizontally around the body at the strongest part of the chest.\nHip measurement: \u00a0The hip is measured in the same way as above. \u00a0Measure horizontally at the widest area.\nSee our chart below for more guidance:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we reach our goal, you will be sent a survey to ensure you get the size you requested.\n\n\n\n\n\nShipping costs will be charged after the campaign is finished. The reason for this is that due to COVID there is massive volatility on shipping prices and fixing them months in advance from our side could translate to higher costs for everyone. \u00a0Our \u00a0estimation is that the cost will be around USD $20. \u00a0We will be working hard to achieve the best balance of shipping speed and cost efficiency for you. \u00a0We will remain 100% transparent regarding shipping costs and will pass on any potential savings. \u00a0We don't profit at all from shipping but actually subsidise part of the shipping costs. \u00a0We are working with our 3PL supplier to get the best rates possible. \u00a0Please note that your battery and coat will come in separate shipments as the battery has to be mailed through a different shipping channel and doing it this way will make it as cost effective as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you need to exchange your coat due to size not being right you will need to ship the coat to us at your expense however we will re ship to you at our expense. \u00a0Coat must be returned unwashed, in same condition you received it. \u00a0It cannot have been worn.\n\n\n\n\nWe acknowledge that we are on the lands of the Wurundjeri people of the Kulin Nations who have been custodians of this land for thousands of years, and acknowledge and pay our respects to their Elders past, present and emerging."

Food trucks will have to submit their menu's the night before so that daily polls can be set up to see what neighborhoods are interested in having which food trucks come to their neighborhood. Meaning if Susan's neighborhood has 10 people that would like hibachi and frank lives in another neighborhood and has only himself interested, the truck would go to susan's neighborhood. Would also offer online ordering so you can pick up your food instead of having to wait in lines. This eliminates boring regular food pick up, eliminates having the same meals everyday because the menu would change daily or weekly. How Nice would it be to be able to step foot out your house and to be able to get different meals daily....without having to drive or shop. Customers could also vote on food choices they'd like available on the trucks."

        "Text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor nearly a decade, LiONCooler has been known for its battery-powered solar fridge freezers and our dedication to providing off-grid and portable power solutions to consumers. We\u2019re so excited and proud to introduce the LiONCooler Pro, the newest technology in the portable, fridge, freezer, cooler market - designed with more versatility with a battery that also functions as an external power bank so you can power on-the-go.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEveryone knows that when the ice melts, there\u2019s condensation, water drips everywhere and food gets soggy. Those are the old days, the LiONCooler Pro needs no ice. The integrated compressor allows the cooler to function as a refrigerator or freezer except in a portable and cordless design.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe LiONCooler Pro has all of the advantages of your home\u2019s refrigerator but it\u2019s designed to be completely portable, battery-operated and cordless so you can take it with you in your car, RV, boat, camping, fishing, tailgating and you want to enjoy cold food and drinks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you\u2019re on the road or the outdoors, you want a reliable, portable, cooler. The LiONCooler Pro features a powerful temperature control system that can maintain a steady temperature even in the most extreme environments engineered with a DC compressor and a long-lasting Lithium-ion battery, giving you up to 12 hours of uninterrupted chilling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe LiONCooler Pro lets you quickly recharge its removable battery in 3 convenient ways: using the AC wall outlet of your home or hotel room, a DC 12v socket from your vehicle and using solar power panels. For a complete off-grid experience, pair the LiONCooler Pro with solar power panels from ACOPower to enjoy cool drinks and food in the backcountry. The charging cycle takes 4 to 6 hours and the battery holds power for 12 hours with two batteries you can enjoy 24 hours of battery-operated cooling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike other fridge-freezer coolers, the LiONCooler Pro is 100% mobile - no need to keep it plugged into your vehicle our electrical outlet. The powerful battery stays operating for up to 12 hours and can be recharged in the car or with a solar power panel at the campsite, beach, tailgate or park.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s right: you can finally forget about those messy coolers that require ice to keep food and drinks cold and can quickly become a soggy mess. The LiONCooler Pro puts the ice in the past, offering you a smart, dry, realizable and portable fridge and freezer experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile you want some things frozen, some other things should just be refrigerated. LiONCooler Pro features both functions powered by its high-quality DC Compressors. Simply adjust the desired function you need it for at any time using the device\u2019s digital LCD display\u2014choosing from -20\u2103 Freezing to a milder adjustable Chilling function, without having its temperature affected by the weather.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the Lithium-ion battery is removable, you can take it out and use it as a standalone powerbank for your phone, laptop, outdoor lighting and other devices with USB ports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiONCooler Pro is designed to be as convenient as a trolley bag. Simply pull the telescopic handle and you\u2019re good to go. Seamlessly take your LiONCooler Pro anywhere, without lifting or holding it, and enjoy its robust all-terrain 6 inches extra-large wheels that will literally let you take it off-road.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe removable multi-purpose lid provides more access to your cooler and can also be used as a food prep table. Plus, you can easily remove to wash and clean. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother key feature that makes LiONCooler Pro innovative is the ability to charge through solar power. Just connect the cooler directly to a solar power panel and enjoy the green and environmentally-friendly charging and keep drinks and food cold completely off-grid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant even more convenience? If temperature changes outdoors or if you simply want to adjust the chilling temperature of the device, you can adjust the cooler\u2019s temperature on the digital LCD display or remotely, from its free Bluetooth App available for iOS or Android.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrowdfunding is not new to us, we successfully funded our first project here: the 3rd generation LiONCooler. Since then, the LiONCooler has been tried and tested by thousands of consumers, it has even been used in the most sensitive medical environments, transporting medicine and organs, where reliable and steady temperatures are critically important.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what\u2019s new? The LiONCooler Pro has a better 193Wh/52000mAh battery, that not only functions as a battery for your cooler but as a power bank for all devices. Plus, the battery is equipped with a double-sided type-c PD 60W and LED light so you have a flashlight when you need it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#Review for LiONCooler\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiONCooler Pro comes in three available capacities that you can choose from, according to your requirements: PX30 (30L), PX40 (40L), and PX50 (50L).\n\nWhat's in the box?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n90w Compatible Solar Panel\n\n\n\n*Available as an add-on\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiONCooler products are all designed by our parent company ACOPOWER. \u00a0ACOPOWER is dedicated to making off-grid living easy with its solar and mobile power products for auto, caravan, RV, boat, tiny home and cabins.

When used in color, a color filter can be inserted between the backlight and the screen to change the color into seven different colors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Beeboard Tub\" has 7,000 dots and \"Beeboard Graffiti\" has 14,000 dots.

The conveyor belt gradually rolls during the printing process, which can realize the continuous printing of batch models, as well as the printing of an infinite length model. With Infinity3D, you seem to have a small processing plant.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe high-strength fiber woven conveyor belt allows the model to stick firmly and will automatically peel off when the model is transferred to the end. This is the key to realize batch printing without manual operation in the whole process.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed a larger printing area? Infinity3D was designed to print extra-large projects that fit the size of big dreams\u2014supporting to build volume of 250*215*\u221emm in 45\u00b0 mode and 250*220*323mm in 90\u00b0mode. The users can print whatever they desire on a large creative scale.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a 3.5-inch full-color touch screen, you can check the printing status, function display, parameter setting at a glance. Furthermore, Infinity3D is compatible with U disk and SD card offline printing. So, everyone can start work quickly.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfinity3D is equipped with filament interruption detection and print resume function. The photoelectric induction will timely remind if the filament runs out or breaks midway. In case of power off, Infinity3D will continue to finish printing after the power supply is resumed.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfinity3D combines with industrial linear guide rails and TMC2209 motor drivers. Compared with low-end 3D printers with rollers and \u00a0A4988 drivers, Infinity3D provides higher printing accuracy, longer life, smoother movement, and lower working noise.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo provide efficient and convenient printing, we optimized the slicing function\uff0cand added a continuous printing typesetting plug-in based on the Cura high-speed slicing engine. So, the operation is simple and easy to use. Even a beginner can operate the printer skillfully.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0As senior 3D printer lovers, we are troubled when printing 3D models in large quantities. Because the current 3D printers cannot print continuously, we bought many 3D printers and set an alarm clock to remind ourselves to get up at midnight to shovel the print model and start a new print. But, unfortunately, this kind of work around the clock gives us a headache. So, based on years of experience in 3D printers, we decided to develop a 3D printer that can continuously print for 7*24hours.\u00a0\nWe are a group of young, passionate, and creative 3D printing enthusiasts. To make 3D printing technology better meet the needs of various industries, we designed and developed infinity. We believe Infinity3D is the right product for education, healthcare, architecture, business, or hobbyists. We were hoping you could join us to lead the future with Infinity3D.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 2,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $900M raised between them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Using GPS technology the APP moves with you and updates you on the surrounding safety conditions as you move from around your city, your country or around the world. Currently, We have identified and captured crime data within the U.S. and Covid-19 data within 180 countries world-wide, however we are seeking funding to expand our data collection efforts so that we can offer this app to all nations.\nImagine travelling to a new City in which you have never been and trying to navigate the streets not knowing if it is safe, not knowing the crime rate, what is the Covid rate, where is the nearest police or hospital, how do I contact emergency services if I need them, and if in a foreign country, where is the nearest embassy? The Move Alert APP answers all of those questions by simply pressing the appropriate button and seeing the information you need. Further, you will be connected to local law enforcement and receive voice, data and video alerts informing you of adverse activities in your area. With your help we can provide this information not just to citizens who travel within their own countries but as individuals travel to all parts of the world the APP will immediately sync with the crime and Covid data in those regions.\nWe are seeking a community of supporters that can provide feedback to us over the lifetime of this project as we seek to put this APP in the hands of over 1 Billion People World-Wide. Whether your donation is $1 or $10,000, you will join our flagship supporters program and will be given periodic updates about our APP as it expands from country to country.\nThe Basic Move Alert APP will be provided FREE to every Citizen world-wide and includes all of the health and safety functionality. The Premium Move Alert APP will include all Basic features and additional communication features with expanded data for foreign travels.\nAnother exciting feature of the Move Alert APP is that Schools, Communities, Cities, Law Enforcement Agencies and Governments can use a secure web based Communications Portal Page to direct message its Citizens using voice, data and video messaging.\u00a0\nCreated by Tierranova, LLC based in the United States with the support of \u00a0a local University and a local Technology Funding Group, the company worked with an India based Company to develop this APP for the past 24 Months. It is worth noting that the US and India are among the top 3 countries in the world with the highest cases of Covid outbreaks, which intensified the relationship of our two companies.\nThe inventor, Ron Daniels, is a technology professional with over 30 years holds a Masters Degree in Engineering and is an expert in database technology and analytics. He initially created the APP to address the growing crime rates within the US in particular mass shootings. In 2020, the APP was upgraded to include Covid data as this pandemic affected the health and safety of all humans world-wide. He is passionate about getting the APP to all corners of the world because his life has been touched by both aspects of Crime and Covid, having lost a brother to violent crime at a young age and most recently losing his Father to Covid in 2020."

There is an illustrated glossary to help you understand all the difficult terms. \u00a0\u00a0\nTo see our entire library of courses you can go to our site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0What is BioBrain?\n\nBioBrain is a globally accessible education platform that enables anyone to learn STEM independently or collaboratively in a classroom.\nThere are 300 million secondary school students in the world studying STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). Accessing high quality STEM resources in an interactive online format can be difficult, if not impossible. This makes it challenging for students to prepare themselves for post secondary education or the skilled jobs of the future.\nFor teachers, BioBrain is an excellent tool to use for flipped learning or formative assessment. Teachers can assign short quizzes at the end of each section, enabling both students and teachers to quickly identify where there may be knowledge gaps. BioBrain allows for adaptive and personalised learning with teachers able to assign work to the whole class or just a few students.\nMany teachers are currently using BioBrain at the start of their classes to assess understanding of the scientific concepts covered in the previous lesson by assigning quizzes for the students to complete or as a tool to determine what topics to cover before the end of year examinations. Other teachers are using BioBrain to help plan their lessons.\nYou can easily use BioBrain on the go, as they catch the bus, train or tram home from school or alternatively, at their desk preparing for end of year examinations.\n\nBioBrain is being used in over 30 countries and has been receiving excellent reviews from teachers and students around the globe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow was the app and its content developed?\n\nBioBrain has been developed by a team of content developers from their respective disciplines, Biology, Chemistry, and Physics. These professionals are all experienced teachers and scientists with the highest academic rigour and have front of mind the needs of today\u2019s digital learners and teachers. All our subjects, Biology, Chemistry, and Physics, are curriculum aligned and contain scientific diagrams to aid understanding.\nThe BioBrain content is graded over three levels and broken in to short bite sized chunks to facilitate short interactions with the learning materials. BioBrain also contains an illustrated glossary that is linked to throughout the learning material.\n\n\nIs the age of the textbook coming to an end?\n\nModern teaching recognises that everyone has a different learning styles. At BioBrain, we believe that the current digital native learners and their teachers want to use technology to facilitate their learning and teaching. They have grown up using digital tools on their phones for a variety of needs, such as reading the news, watching sport, checking the weather, and communicating with friends through social media. Today\u2019s learners expect to find all their information on mobile devices as a source of truth. They dip in and out of different platforms and activities frequently. BioBrain\u2019s short quizzes and learning material broken down into small chunks allows for this. The BioBrain products are extremely visual with each subject having different colours and all scientific diagrams match the corresponding subject colours.\n\nSubjects available:\n\nBiology, Chemistry and Physics\n\n\nABOUT OUR FOUNDER\nCaroline Cotton is the founder of BioBrain, an Edtech platform with the mission of providing learning tools, accessible to anyone with a desktop or mobile device. As a Biology and Chemistry teacher, Caroline noticed that students where less interested in reading textbooks. She is now focused on getting students excited about STEM and making learning fun and engaging for them.\u00a0\n\nFUNDS AND TIMING\nWe are now working towards developing additional STEM subjects, beginning with Year 10 Science and continuing with Mathematics and other STEM subjects. We are also perfecting the web-based platform and tailoring the curriculum for different geographies around the world.\n\nWe need your help to create the Year 10 Science content for the app and the web-based platform. We have secured 60% of the funds required for the development however, the Covid situation has made it difficult to work with the developers in the usual way. This campaign aims to collect the remaining 40% of the needed funds. Most of the raised money will go to content creation and building the web page.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0November: Kickstarter campaign\n\u00a0December: Kickstarter releases funds\n\u00a0December - January: Year 10 Science content development\u00a0\n\u00a0February: Final editing and quality control\n\u00a0March: Release of BioBrain Year 10 Science!\n\nREWARDS\nWhile Year 10 Science is the principal item on offer, other reward tiers include access to BioBrains existing content for both students and teachers.\u00a0\n\nFIND US ON SOCIAL MEDIA\nBioBrain - Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn\nCaroline Cotton - LinkedIn\n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!"

There is no pinching of the auricle, no blockage of the ear canal, no pain or damage to hearing. So you can enjoy precision audio without worrying about ear discomfort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChat with your running buddy while listening to Beethoven\u2019s 5th symphony. Who says you can\u2019t have both?\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nOladance keeps your ears open, so you\u2019ll never lose track of what\u2019s happening around you \u2014 whether you\u2019re running down a city block, cycling on the road, or waiting for the airline attendant to call your row. Keeping you safe, while keeping you in the moment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe right fit, for all your moves. Molded to fit the natural curve of your ear, Oladance has a multi-point support system that spreads the weight of the buds evenly across your ear, eliminating sore spots. So you can wear them all day without discomfort. It also offers a stable fit that offers reassurance whatever the day brings. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Oladance Wearable Stereos move when you do, and where you do. \u00a0So jump, skip, flip\u2026 Or just relax. And they are made with soft, skin-friendly silicone, easy to keep on even during your longest workouts. Your earbuds aren\u2019t going anywhere.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nPlus, the Oladance features an extra-strong memory titanium wireframe, which has a certain degree of elasticity and can return to its original shape after bending. This means you won't have to worry about the inconvenience to put on your ear, or dropping one while you\u2019re on the move.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a reason we call them the Wearable Stereos, not just earbuds - wearing them is like having a home stereo wherever you go. Oladance lets you feel that the sound is coming from everywhere outside in a natural way, a totally different listening experience with nothing blocking the ear.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's also a stereo that only you can hear. Oladance channels rich, full sound towards you and away from others.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo powerful 16.2mm drivers combine to bring you acoustic brilliance. With drivers three times the size of Apple\u2019s Airpods, they create an audio experience that\u2019s more like an intimate concert setting, and less like a pair of earphones. And the top bio-diaphragm technology offers a rich, consistent listening experience at any volume, from crisp and clear highs to excitingly powerful lows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Keep your bass tuned with Oladance\u2019s virtual bass and dynamic EQ technology. Using automatic hearing compensation, they deliver even sound at different frequencies. Indoor and outdoor, providing a stronger sound quality experience at any time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost bone conduction and other open earbuds place their sound unit at the top of the ear, resulting in a distance from the ear holes.\u00a0\nWe improved the structure to make sure the earbuds accurately cover the ear holes without going into them, cutting down on sound leakage effectively, maximizing the sound you hear, while minimizing what everyone else does. \u00a0\nYou hear it all, while they hear nothing at all.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetter conversations start here. The Oladance\u2019s microphone system is designed to lift and amplify your voice while putting a lid on other ambient noise in the background. The patented environmental noise canceling (ENC) algorithm rebuilds the sound of your voice even when external noise threatens to stifle it.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd with nothing stuck in your ear, your conversations feel natural, as though the person is right there next to you\u2026Even when you wish they weren\u2019t. Is that your boss calling?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the 160mAh large capacity battery, plus the breakthrough low-consumption algorithms patents, we optimize the battery life of the stereo to provide up to 16 hours of continuous play per charge for unbearably long flights or workouts that go all night.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the Oladance comes with a non-charging carry case, you can also grab an add-on charging case to extend the performance. With this large battery capacity case (2550mAh), the total playtime is extended to 94.4 hours! No need to recharge the case in 2 months if you use it for 1.5 hours a day.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the unbeatable battery performance and comfortable design, the Oladance is made to stay in place all day \u2013 even during those jump-rope sessions and backcountry cycling trips.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay and pause your music, skip tracks, adjust volume, and take calls \u2014 all with only a tap. The Oladance Wearable Stereos feature a touch control glass panel that puts you in control, so you never miss or press the wrong button even when you\u2019re on the move.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThat means that whether you\u2019re chatting with Siri or browsing your newest playlist, you can control everything simply by tapping your Oladances with one finger.\nProduct Comparison\nAs the product is such a unique innovation in every detail, we find it quite difficult to succinctly explain its advantages. \u00a0We hope this comparison table is helpful for our early supporters.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0A Dash Of Colors\nSay what you want to say - without speaking a word. With four dynamic colors to choose from, including Interstellar Blue, Space Silver, Martian Orange and Cloud White, there\u2019s a color for every character. We will collect your color preference for each unit after the campaign ends through the Kickstarter survey.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0What\u2019s In The Box\u00a0\nPlease note that the Oladance Wearable Stereos have a non-charging carry case in the box.

According to Oladance's laboratory test results, sound leakage could not be found at 74dB of loudness in the quiet indoor environment, and the decibels could be adjusted to higher levels in the outdoor environment, which is significantly better than other products on the market. Note that actual performance may vary depending on environmental conditions and music types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were named one of  ProductHype's  Best Kickstarter Projects of 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The unique \"Evolution Bikes Seniors Edition\".\u00a0Nothing like this in the market at the moment.\nAny e-bike in the world reach that level of spphistication, the Evolution Bike Seniors Edition is unique.\nThese e-bikes are innovative. Nothing quite like them exists at the moment and it's just a beginning for us! They will be first to the market. The chance of success of this project is near 90%+ as most of the technology we plan to adapt for our e-bikes already exists for different applications or need to be custom made. We will design our prototypes by adding the desired technological improvements to the e-bikes we already manufacture.\nOur actual manufacturing plant can produce 10,000 units per month.\nWe believe all micromobility projects should be supported because they are the future... The e-bikes it's a trend and the market are wide open!\n\n\u00a0STUDIES:\n\nThe benefits of e-bikes for seniors are tremendous! Cycling on an e-bike when you are older might be the only way that you can continue to ride a bike. Relying on pedaling alone might just be too much! Having a battery to assist you makes cycling easier and more enjoyable as you age.\nMany studies agree that e-bikes for seniors would have a very positive impact as they allow for better lifestyle, morale, and socialization as well as lower blood pressure and many other benefits. The researcher Dr Tim Jones PhD qualify the e-bike ride as a \"MICRO ADVENTURE\"! (below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE STUDY BELOW ARE GUIDELINES THAT SUPPORT, BY THE VOICE OF SCIENCE, THE CHALLENGE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR PROJECT FOR SENIORS (Please click for the full report):\n\n\n\nThis study is an important study if you like to learn more about E-Bike and elderly. Please click here.\n\n\n\nAny contributions received in excess of our base funding goal will be used to purchase e-bike inventory to be offered to seniors at a lower cost.\n\nEvolution Bikes Inc. is a Canadian company that has been manufacturing and assembling high-quality electric bikes for five years. We now aim to create a prototype model expressly adapted to the needs of seniors. To our knowledge, nothing like this currently exists on the world market. Seniors have been totally ignored, yet studies have confirmed that an e-bike can provide a better quality of life by increasing mobility and access to the outdoors. We need your help to foster the technology necessary to tailor an e-bike to this underserved population.\u00a0\n\nWe believe all micro-mobility projects should be supported for a better the future..\n\n\"Several years ago, I tried to buy an electric bike with a throttle, but was told by the salesperson in the bike shop that such bikes were for \u201clazy people\u201d; they only sold bikes that suited their mission of encouraging people to exerciseI was disappointed, but I continued searching and finally found one with a throttle. As today, they change their mind and understand the needs of the elderly\".\nHowever, this bike had the drawback of a small, 10-amp battery that would only power the bike for around 25 miles before dying. This would mean that if I started a ride on a beautiful Sunday morning, traveling at 15 miles per hour, I would have to turn around after 45 minutes to get back home or face having to pedal for 25 miles, which is more than I can do. It was a no-win situation\u2014I would either return exhausted or frustrated by the short trip.\nThis e-bike did not meet my needs, but I was passionate about pursuing the freedom that micromobility can offer. After talking with friends and other elders, I realized that I was not alone. Everybody was interested but expressed legitimate fears\u2014getting stuck far from home and having to pedal farther than was comfortable, falling, or becoming lost in the labyrinth of bike paths.\nAfter six years of e-biking and studying the question, I joint Evolution Bikes Inc., and little by little, we continue to refine our e-bikes. Now, after eleven total years of engineering, manufacturing, and selling e-bikes while remaining constantly on the lookout for emerging technologies, my team and I have identified the components that will make an e-bike appealing to seniors. We are ready to put together the right technologies and produce the first e-bike for senior citizens at a reasonable price.\nWe plan to finish the first ten prototypes by June 2022. Next, we will push for worldwide sales to end users.\nWe need your help to make this happen.\n\n\n\"EVOLUTION BIKES\" SPEAKS THROUGH THE VOICE OF SCIENCE (3 min 21 s):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0PR\u00c9SENTATION FRAN\u00c7AISE DU PROJET:\n\u00a0(2 min 58 s)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(3 min 26 s)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWELCOME TO VISIT THE FACTORY \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(1 min 26 s):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0THE FINAL ASSEMBLY, THE HIGHLIGHTS:\u00a0\n\u00a05 LEVELS OF ASSISTANCE + THROTTLE\u00a0\n\n\n\nTHROTTLE\n\n\nBATTERIES:\n\nThe average battery in the market is 8 to 10 amps, which translates to 10 to 15 miles of autonomy\u2014this is too little for seniors, who also need power for the ride back home. Our planned batteries will provide 17 to 20 amps, which should allow the user to ride between 50 and 99 miles, easily. This is a major factor for the elderly. At the moment, lithium batteries are predominant, but LiFePO4 (also known as lithium iron phosphate) batteries are a huge improvement over lead acid batteries in weight , capacity, and shelf life, and far better than lithium ion batteries. The LiFePO4 batteries are the safest type of lithium batteries, offering more millage with less charging. We are currently studying the exent of these benefits, with more information to come... LiFePO4 batteries are an improvement on standard lithium batteries, offering higher capacity, longer shelf life, and lower weight.\n\n\n\n\nE-BIKE BATTERY RANGE CHART (OUR TARGET FOR OPTIMAL VALUE TO OUR SENIOR BIKES IS IN RED)\n\n\n\n\u00a0THE 2022 \"EVOLUTION E-BIKES SENIORS EDITION\" DISPLAY IS EASY TO READ:\u00a0\n\nMany e-bike companies offer a small display that is too hard to read, like this one.

        "Text": "Meet the Wearable Robotic Taking Hiking&Fitness to New Extremes\nIntroducing SPORTSMATE 5, the world\u2019s first and lightest portable wearable robotic exoskeleton made for consumers. It\u2019s form-fitting functionality makes every stride comfortable with controllable resistance and assistance to achieve your fitness goals. From distance to strength-training, SPORTSMATE 5 covers it all.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nSPORTSMATE 5 entirely transforms the notion of wearable robotics.\u00a0\nExoskeletons of this nature have existed for decades for military, industrial, and rehabilitation fields. Those designs are bulky, heavy, expensive, and designed for singular use cases. We\u2019re applying exoskeletons to daily life, altering the way you interact with the world\uff01\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper Early Bird Offer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedia Coverages & Reviews\u00a0\nMajor tech media MUO highly appreciated the fitness mode of SPORTSMATE 5\n\n\n\nRead full reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does SPORTSMATE 5 apply to your daily life?\nIt\u2019s easy. There are two powerful actuators at your hips on the exoskeleton. These provide assistance when you need to save energy and aim to go physically further, or resistance when your goal is training muscle. Two modes are designed for quick usage.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\nOutdoor mode: Switch between Assistance & Resistance\nFitness mode: Switch between Resistance in forms of extension & flexion\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutdoor Mode: Get easier for a long-distance walking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Up to 18 Nm assistance torque\u00a0\nUp to 3 hours / 6.5 miles of full power\n\nAssistance from the 2 actuators lift your legs and push them forward to make every step light as air. You will feel much easier while walking, going upstairs and uphill. Get rid of gulping air, sweating all over, and slow walking. Resistance in outdoor mode increases your stability by holding your body and absorbing the shaking while going downstairs or downhill. In a word, outdoor mode of SPORTSMATE 5 helps decrease strain & increase distance and lets you enjoy the fun of outdoor activities, like hiking, trekking, backpacking, even mountaineering!\n\nFitness Mode: Burn More, Gain More\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUp to 10 Nm resistance torque\nWide applications: from Pilates to outdoor training\n\nHere is where our resistance actuators shine. Fitness Mode focuses on burning more calories and gaining more muscle strength in less time than a traditional workout routine. Resistance comes from different forms for our exoskeleton: extension and flexion. You are free to choose the resistance that fits your routine best for incredible results, for example, choose extension resistance while doing half-squats to train your gluteal muscle or use flexion resistance on leg raising training to strengthen the hamstring tendon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore applications with customized SPORTSMATE 5 accessories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Weight Lifting Accessory: Quick detachable, Up to 15kg weight lifting assistance. \u00a0\n\u00a0Knee Brace: Customized detachable knee braces for SPORTSMATE 5 to protect your knees when working out.\n\n\nHow SPORTSMATE 5 Works\uff1f\nSPORTSMATE 5 has three subsystems: the gait controller system (central controller), the actuator system, and the energy system. In outdoor mode, your gait behavior will be detected by sensors and processed by our AI algorithm. Then the controller will send signals to the drivers so that motors can deliver appropriate assistance to you.\n\n\n\nIn fitness mode, motors can provide different levels of resistance for burning more calories. Meanwhile, our intelligent energy system can harvest the energy from your movement and recharge the battery to achieve a longer duration.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0An AI-based Control System: Adapt to Complex Environment\u00a0\n\nWe've developed our innovative torque-based AI algorithm to adapt to complex environments compared to traditional exoskeletons, which used trajectory algorithms for medical rehabilitation purposes. More agile and flexible. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAI algorithm analyzes data from the motor encoder to detect the wearer\u2019s gait behavior, providing precise torque support with every stride. Depending on the gait pattern, SPORTSMATE 5 can detect the user\u2019s activity (e.g., hiking, jogging) and intuitively adjust the upper-level algorithm. The lower-level controller receives that reference and sends the proper signal to the motor drivers.\n\n\n\u00a0Quasi-Direct Drive Actuation: Extreme Low Mechanical Impedance\u00a0\n\nUnlike traditional exoskeletons using high ratio transmission systems for patient stability, we implemented our quasi-direct actuator system, consisting of high torque density motors with low ratio transmission systems. Users can have more participation while in use without the traditional result of high mechanical impendence. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of assistance, our actuator system can provide 50% of torque required by hip joints during a gait cycle for normal males.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPORTSMATE 5 Perfectly Fits Your Body with Cyber-Fit \u00a0System \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nQuasi-Soft Robotic Architecture\n\nOur consumer wearable robotic exoskeleton uses adaptable rigid elements along the waistbelt to perfectly adapt to a wider range of body shapes. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectric Inflatable Airbag\n\nTo further fit the belt around your waist, an electric inflatable airbag fills the gap between your waist and the exoskeleton, providing better stability and more comfort.\nSingle air pump inflation lasts for 10 seconds.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Most Compact, Easy-to-Wear Robotics Ever \u00a0\u00a0\nWeighing in at just 2.5kg, the SPORTSMATE 5 is ultralight wearable robotics made for consumers. It\u2019s composed of multiple high-strength composite materials including carbon fiber reinforced plastic and aerospace aluminum alloy.\nIt\u2019s compact form factor makes it easy to pack up and carry just as easy as it is to wear, taking about 1 minute to put on.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdaptable Energy System for Extended Use\nIn hiking mode, the battery provides steady and sufficient power output for different use-case scenarios. With our QDD actuation, less energy is wasted by the inconformity between use and device, thus achieving better sustainability.\nDepending on user movement, our smart energy system can harvest energy while in use. Going downstairs, training, hiking, and more can recharge the battery making SPORTSMATE 5 last even longer.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Extended Interface for Developers\n\n\n\n\n\nWe believe the future of consumer-friendly wearable exoskeletons is just breaching the surface. There\u2019s so much more potential. To help further the application and development of wearable robotic tech, we\u2019re providing a developer box with an extended interface with 2 UARTs, 8 DIOs, and 4 AIOs. You\u2019re free to develop any application and run your own experiments. Welcome to the EXOSKELETON WORLD. We expect great things from you!\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Sizes, Unlimited Potential\nChoose the size that fits your body most closely to get the best experience out of SPORTSMATE 5.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s in the Box\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerks for Early Supports \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Enhanced Robotics Team Story\nWe\u2019re a startup that focuses on the research and development of exoskeleton robotics. We seek to improve the quality of life by providing people with accessible, user-friendly robotics that enhances mobility. After 4 years of research and clinical verification, we are launching our first exoskeleton, SPORTSMATE 5, dedicated to outdoor and fitness enthusiasts. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nLeon Zhu, CEO of Enhanced Robotics, shows us how ER has improved the prototypes of SPORTSMATE in the past four years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline\u00a0\u00a0\nWe offer global shipping to anywhere in the world, and we've cooperated with carriers like FedEx, UPS, DHL, and USPS. Please note that the price doesn't include shipping costs, taxes, or additional duty. COVID-19 is still delaying international shipping in many places, but things are better now, and we hope that by the time we start shipping, the delivery time can be back to normal. We will update you with the whole shipping process continuously.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "Text": "Good Day\nI have been in an extensive knowledge base training for the last five months under Dean Graziosi and Tony Robbins. I recently became a life coach, and I am developing a Course at Mastermind.com to assist young adults who aged out of the foster care system, secured housing and employment but still need guidance to strengthen their confidence and independence to build a fulfilling life through simple mindset techniques, basic life skills and career mentorship. As I build this Four Week Course, I realize one of the most important factors to getting through this course is having an accountability buddy. I too have an accountably buddy as I continue my training and I know I could not have gotten this far without the accountability partner. So, this is where the idea of creating an app for finding an accountability buddy came about. Since I use this technique and the young adults, I will be coaching will also be using this technique I feel it\u2019s a need for many.\u00a0\nThis app will help you determine what it is you are looking for accountability on and match you with another person looking for the same kind of accountability. The partners will decide how often they will need to meet virtually to go over what they accomplished thus far and what they intend to be accountable for next. The app will be used for goal settings, showing progress and reward system for completing tasks.\nStudies found that people who commit to their goal in front of another person are 65 percent more likely to achieve it, as reported by Entrepreneur.com. Likelihood of success rises to 95 percent when those same people commit to ongoing meetings with those accountability partners, to check in on their progress.\nI truly feel this is a necessity for the many who are trying to set goals and accomplish them. I think having a user friendly app to help with the process of finding and keeping an accountability buddy will help this technique thrive."

The most advanced audio interface devoted to improving collaboration and workflow between music producers.\nDesigned as a compact 3in-1out audio interface with stereo analog output. Combined with a\u00a0 software utility application for full control over hardware properties and synchronization settings.\n\n\n\n\n\nMulti-USB input digital audio mixer\nWith 3 USB-C inputs, PULSETRIO also functions as a true digital audio mixer allowing for simultaneous listening of up to audio sources. \u00a0A \u00a03 x 1/8 Headphone and 2 x 1/4inch main output connections give maximum audition versatility \u00a0whether working in the studio or collaborating on the road.\nThis means you can use PULSETRIO as a standard audio interface with the ability listen to audio from all connected USB sources at the same time!\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nDAW Synchronization Technology\nPULSETRIO's patented technology consists of a single audio interface device with multiple USB-C inputs and a utility software application that interacts with the connected users' DAW application. Capable of connecting several computers with any of the supported DAW platforms and synchronizing them to each other, allowing real-time simultaneous collaboration. \u00a0As a result, all the users will be able to listen to their combined audio, and individual collaboration parts, while also being in sync with each other. This results in smoother collaboration with less time spent rendering files.\u00a0\n\nEvery modern producer has experienced the difficulties of collaboration in its current form. Its un organized, cumbersome and repeated rendering of files takes up valuable time that could be used for creating. As a result, its apparent a major challenge in modern music collaboration is the diversity of software [DAW] applications music producers use to create. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PULSE utility control application allows for smooth integration of the hardware and DAW. Synchronizing with the controls on the hardware the utility application is a complete collaboration control center designed to synchronize music production workflow.\n\n\n\n\n\nMulti-DAW Compatibility\nPULSETRIO works natively with the latest version of\u00a0FL Studio for OSX. Additionally,\u00a0\nthe device is compatible with many DAW programs that support MIDI external sync.\nSupported DAWs include:\n\nFL Studio* - native OSX integration, windows support in development.\nAbleton* -[MIDI] Link native integration in development.\u00a0\nReason - [MIDI]\nCubase - [MIDI]\nReaper - [MIDI]\nNI Maschine- [MIDI]\nMPC Software- [MIDI]\nProtools* - In development\nLogicX* - on roadmap for future integration.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0*Early bird units will be upgraded at no cost.\n\n\n\n\n\nImproved Workflow\nPULSETRIO can be used in multiple configurations. Each port can connect up to 3 FL studio, 3 MIDI compatible DAWs, or a combination there of and efficiently synchronize their workflow.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Status\u00a0\nWe have produced 30 working Early Adopter units that are ready to ship. However, due to worldwide chip shortages, availability and minimums, we need backers like you to be able to source enough components to produce our product in volume. We also want to give the opportunity for early backers to get their hands on a unit as soon as possible, as they help us shape the experience going forward.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe have ambitious goals to integrate not only OSX but windows computers into a universal workflow. With backer support we can \u00a0focus on windows development. We are also in preparation to begin development to natively integrate Ableton Live, another milestone in our roadmap. This and many other great upgrades and features are top of mind.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTeam\nWe are a team of developers, software engineers and designers who have a passion for music. \u00a0Founded by Mario \"Wizzo\" Fernandez, Grammy nominated producer engineer and Co-Founded by Mark Seel, a firmware and software engineer [musician] with over 25yrs of experience in software architecture ranging from multi-threaded PC applications to low-power wireless communications firmware.\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline\n\n\u00a0May 2016: Bitstream Audio was founded.\u00a0\n\u00a0May 2017: First patent was granted.\u00a0\n\u00a0April 2018: Second patent was granted.\u00a0\n\u00a0Sept 2019: Pulse prototypes are completed.\n\u00a0March 2020: Software development begins.\n\u00a0April 2020: Early bird units in production.\u00a0\n\u00a0Jul 2020: FL Studio Integration.\n\u00a0Sept 2021: Limited \u00a0first edition Pulse Trio units are done and ready to be shipped.\u00a0\n\u00a0Nov 2021: Kickstarter campaign starts.\n\u00a0Jan 2022: Early bird units ship.\n\u00a0Early 2022: Ableton integration .*\n\u00a0Mid 2020: Windows support.*\n\u00a0Late 2022: Kick Starter supporters receive units.\u00a0\n\n*these updates will be provided to early backers at no additional cost.\u00a0\nFunding / Budget\nThis product represents a long devoted journey to improve the way musicians create in a modern environment. \u00a0The good news is we've done most of the hard work.

Since there is no one-size-fits-all DAW, or Digital Work Station, music producers have a variety of choices when selecting a platform.\u00a0\n\nCurrent DAW platforms all have a unique workflow, file structure and often completely different computer operating system compatibility . These differences in DAW platform, result and manifest themselves as digital barriers in the creative musical process. \u00a0Modern music producers are often handy capped when collaborating due to the difference in their music production software. \u00a0Contrary for example, a traditional musician would not worry about a Fender guitar not being compatible with a Pearl drum set when in a jam session. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nNowadays, music producers have to be resourceful to collaborate efficiently. Often having to use multiple audio interfaces, \u00a0audio mixers \u00a0and other clever ways to synchronize their workflow. More often turning into a situation where producers are detached, yet all somehow still working together. This workflow is counter productive to a free flowing synchronized collaboration session, where each user is collaborating from their own workstation.\n\nThe concept for PULSETRIO was born in a real life studio session. Bitstream Audio founder and Grammy nominated producer engineer, \"wizzo\" collaborated along side multi-platinum producers, 'Mike Free' and 'LilJon'. All three participants had different DAW platforms: Ableton, Reason and MPC2 software. By a combination of \u00a0synchronized start button pressing, wireless transfer of files, multiple aux connections into multi-channel analog audio mixers, they achieved that which now you can do with one PULSETRIO. \u00a0The inefficiencies in music production collaboration and issues experienced that day, and many other sessions occurring all the time, paved the foundation that would become PULSETRIO. Conclusively, the need for a more efficient workflow was born from necessity to collaborate more efficiently.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nSpread the Word\nThank you for your support! \u00a0\u00a0We would be forever grateful\u00a0if you would share PULSETRIO with your audience to help this project come to life!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\nMulti-Input Digital Audio Mixer\nDAW synchronization technology\nPulse Utility Application\n\nDAW Sync Compatibility\nFL Studio \u2013 Native Integration\nAbleton - Native Integration in development\nReason\nCubase\nReaper\nNI Maschine\nMPC Software\n\nIn the Box\nPULSETRIO\nTravel Case\nUSB-C Cables\n\n\n\nTravel Case\n\n\n\n\n\nPulse Trio \n\n\n\n\n\nUSB-C Cable\n\n\n\nWarranty\nWe stand behind our products & services with confidence.

        "Text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Web 3.0, the next generation of the internet\u00a0\nBefore anything, I would like to mention that you have the option to follow on by reading the texts or watching the videos. I have tried my best to explain everything about Web 3.0, from its components to how it functions. Every topic has a headline, video and text, diving deep into the subject. I would recommend watching all the videos from start to end if you want to have a complete understanding of Web 3.0 and DWeb. Otherwise, the why section will explain the main reason behind this project. Thank you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0What is Web 3.0\nIn the early 2000s, with the introduction of Web 2.0, we began communicating with each other and sharing information through centralised services provided by large organisations such as Google and Facebook. We are always relying on these third-party giants to connect us. They are in control of our data in ways that many will not consider ethical. We must have the choice to control our data in sovereignty.\nWith the introduction of Web 3.0, we look forward to an environment where no central authority, censorship and downtime exist. We will be able to log in anonymously and interact with each other using cryptographic (hack-resistant) methods.\nAll of this can become true by introducing DWeb. A Decentralized Web will allow us to finally integrate Web 3.0 into our lives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0What is Decentralization\nBefore explaining decentralization, we need to understand what centralization is. When a user wants to connect to another user or website, they will need to first connect to a server. A server is just a huge computer that manages clients' requests. The main issue here is that these servers may record every data sent or received. Another issue is that we are relying on this one server to manage everything. If the server were to stop working, the whole system will halt. A recent example could be Facebook's 6 hours downtime. In addition, these servers are the main reason we are not the sole owner of our data.\nDecentralization, on the other hand, does not depend on servers to operate. The network is known as a p2p network where users are connected directly and every user is also a server. As a result, instead of one huge server, the network has many small servers. Smart contracts will be used to achieve a p2p network structure.\u00a0\nSmart contracts are simply programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. They typically are used to automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without an intermediary's involvement or time loss.\u00a0\n~https://www.ibm.com/topics/smart-contracts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy: In a decentralized network, no central authority exists so your private data can never be used by large organizations/governments.\nEquality: Smart contracts will always treat users in the same way. Programs cannot discriminate between users whilst organizations can.\nSecurity: Hackers will need to hack 51% of the network to gain access. Since all users are servers, hackers will need to hack more than half the users of the network versus one server. In addition, we will be using cryptography to encrypt data, which has been proven to be the most secure encryption method today.\nTrustworthy: The network is not dependant on any intermediaries. Therefore, the system will be functional with no downtime.\nImmutability: Data on our DWeb is going to be immutable, i.e once a data is created no one can delete it, not even the creators of the network.\u00a0\nQuality: Web 3.0 is ought to be faster than Web 2.0 as there are many servers involved in processing requests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDWeb is the technical term used to describe Web 3.0. Decentralized Web (DWeb) is the infrastructure needed to gain from all the aforementioned benefits and build a DWeb browser, DWebsites, DSM and DGames.\nAs already mentioned, DWeb will not be relying on servers/hosts to run.\nDWeb browser is the medium through which users will be able to access the DWeb and DWebsites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDWebsites or Decentralized Websites are websites that do not rely on a single server/host.\nAfter developing the DWeb, we will concentrate on building a platform for all users to upload their webpages and run a DWebsite as well.\u00a0Users who run a DWebsite are called an administrator. They will be able to control their DWebsite through the DWeb browser.\u00a0\nAs a result, any person will have the chance to own a DWebsite by simply uploading files to the network, with a click of a button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Decentralized Social Media\nWith the development of DWeb, DSM will not be so far fetched. A social media with no downtime or censorship. A social media where you, as the user, are in full control of your data. With the use of smart contracts, users will be able to connect directly with no third-party interference.\u00a0\nImagine being able to share videos, pictures and messages in a decentralized network. For this section, we are planning on developing a page for content creators to share their videos, a page for sharing pictures and another page for sending messages (literally direct messages).\nLastly, I should mention that DSM is going to be more global than the social media we are using today. I explained this in full in the Why section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Decentralized Games\nDecentralization has many benefits but one of the most important ones for this section would be speed. Online games are usually slow and laggy because one server is responsible for many users' requests. In the case of DGames, with every user that joins the network, a server is also added. This will increase speed but we want to go a step further. We want to make sure that users do not face any lags at all, whilst playing. Users or in this case DGamers will download a huge chunk of the DGame onto their localhost/device and the rest will be streamed to play online. Instead of streaming large files such as pictures and sceneries, users will access them through their devices. \u00a0The difference in speed would be the same as the difference in downloading a video and streaming it. Therefore, the result should ensure a fast and smooth experience.\nWe are planning on developing a DGame called Psur, which is briefly explained in the video above.\u00a0\nNote: To develop the DGame, DWeb browser, DSM and Smart contracts, we will need to hit our stretch goals. More on this in the stretch goals section.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Democracy\nDecentralization does come with risks as well. One of the most important risks is a lack of control over users' data. Although it is a benefit for users as it provides privacy, security and ownership, it may be misused in a way that puts other users in danger. Some users may see this as an opportunity to sell illegal products such as weapons. Meanwhile, they can stay anonymous and never get tracked. What's worse is that their data is immutable as well. To overcome such problems, we came up with a concept called DC or Decentralized Centralization!\u00a0\nA group of people known as voters will be responsible for making the DWeb safe and secure. Any user who wishes to become a voter will have to be verified through a KYC verification. We will be responsible for verifying users, to ensure genuine voters. Hence the term DC.\u00a0\nNevertheless, what do voters do? Voters have the power to hide data or even a user. As mentioned, data or users are immutable, so voters can only hide content.\u00a0\nThe process is simple as well. Any user, not necessarily a voter, can report another user or his/her data. We as voters get notified of this report and choose between hiding, not doing anything and changing. When the majority of voters vote for the same option, then the change occurs. Otherwise, the reported content is considered safe. Note that, voters cannot change data/content but rather tags.\nDWeb ought to be global, so some may consider content to be ethical whilst others think otherwise. To address this problem as well, we will be using tags. Every content on the DWeb must have at least one tag attached to it, which summarizes the content. The tag can be a word or an emoji (you may watch the video for a better demonstration). These tags will then be used to separate wanted and unwanted contents. For example, some may consider alcohol as inappropriate content, so they will choose to filter out any content that has an alcohol tag attached to it.\u00a0\nWhat if a tag is inaccurate? Voters will ensure that all tags used are as accurate as they can be. Voters can change the tag of any content. Only in this case do voters have the power to change data on the DWeb.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Click here.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Please watch the video above for a complete explanation of the rewards and what rewards to expect later.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Why\n~ The Golden circle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Don't forget to follow us on Instagram, where we will be the most active."

The platform is still in the early stages of development, but in the current plan its final version will include an app for Android and iOS (using React Native), desktop apps for Windows, macOS and Linux (using Electron), and of course a web app (built with React.js). The idea is the development of a social network that allows users to share research papers, graphs and opinions regarding the various disciplines of science.\n\n\n\nThe Scientific Place is a social network that allows easy and immediate communication between scientists, students and amateurs.\n\n\n\nThe project was born when I was looking for a social network where the main theme was science, but I did not find a social that for design and stability was at the levels of Twitter or Reddit: so, I chose to build it myself, using new and stable technologies, supported by large companies.\n\n\n\nThe Platform is built with React.js (a trademark registered by Facebook) and GraphQL (a trademark registered by The GraphQL Foundation).\n\n\n\nThe platform will give scientists and science lovers the opportunity to communicate with each other through group chats, video calls and a great support to the insertion and sharing of graphs, large files and texts composed with LaTeX.\nYou can find out more here. If you want to see the progress of the work, you can visit the GitHub repository of the social network.\nPersonal email: vincenzo@thescientificplace.com"

        "Text": "Hi hi everyone! And welcome to my first kickstarter!\nI am so happy to present my venture into kickstarter to make a self-designed useful item a reality.\nMy initial idea with designing these chargers started from a simple starting point. I did not particularly like any of the designs I saw.\n\u00a0So I set out to design and make my own!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign philosophy:\nI went into designing this with a few core design choices in mind\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- It needed to fit into a bedroom or office environment\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- \u00a0It needed to have a form factor which neatly holds your phone in place\n\u00a0\u00a0- \u00a0\u00a0It needed to be useable without much hassle\n\nFrom these choices came about 3 designs!\nEach design is manufactured using computer-controlled machining to maintain the single piece aesthetic. This also allows the freedom to design shapes which would be more complicated to achieve using more conventional manufacturing methods.\nAnother conscious choice was that the user's phone is not supposed to lie on top of the platform, but in the device.\nAnd finally, the decision to use wood has allowed it to fit most interiors and\u00a0rooms.\n\nThe results are the ones you see below!\n\nThe Standard type charger\n\n\n\n\n\nThis design is the largest of the three.\nIt has a recessed centre area in which you can place your phone. The gently sloping sides prevent it from sliding out, yet allow you to easily retrieve your phone out whenever so desired.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0outer dimensions are approximately 28 by 18 cm (11\" by 7\") and will comfortably seat a 6.2\" size phone (my own) however I have made sure it will fit a up to a size 6.9\" phone without issue!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Angled type charger\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next type came from the idea of having a design where the charging surface has a small angle, as to allow you to see your phone's screen from a sitting position.\nThe charger also holds the phone in place with the raised edges, which eventually level out at the top of the charger.\nI was especially pleased when I received this make, because the wood gives such an unexpectedly interesting pattern!\nThe outer dimensions of this type are\u00a0approximately 19 by 9 cm (7.5\" by 3.5\") and will also comfortably seat a\u00a06.2\" size phone however you can again fit a 6.9\" size phone without trouble.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe compact type charger\n\n\n\n\n\nThis final design came about after I was suggested to make a smaller version of my first design. I came up with the same phone platform size, however the edges are smaller in size, yet do not hinder phone accessibility.\nIn terms of a smaller more space saving size, I was quite pleased to see how it turned out!\nThe outer dimensions of this type are\u00a0approximately 20 by 11 cm (8\" by 4\") and will, quite a shocker I know, also comfortably seat a \u00a06.2\" size phone. It may not look like it, but I have verified that it will also seat phones up to a 6.9\" too!\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe circuitry and specs\nIt is of course good to know what to expect for performance of any device you have. Without it these would be more akin to bowls and less like chargers.\n\nFast charging is a must and will be possible.\u00a0\nThe Qi standard for wireless charging will be used.\u00a0\nThe power output will be 10W. \u00a0\nPower input is by a USB-C type port on the charger.\n\nAs the charger is made of wood, a concern could be that wood does not mix with electricity. However, wood is an electrical insulator and will not conduct electricity.\u00a0\nAlso the charger is in use it may heat up due to use. However as the circuit board has a thermal cutoff, much like a computer does, and will power down for a while to make sure it does not damage itself in case it ever gets too hot!\n\nDutch design\nThe idea of Dutch Design is to design something reflecting the Dutch spirit of innovation and creative thinking.\u00a0\nThe wood, parts, machining, packaging and components will be sourced from the Netherlands, allowing me to hold myself and my manufacturers to a high standard of quality. I always aim to make something I would want to use and see and by doing it this way I try to maintain this standard.\nThe wood used for this project is multiplex, which resulted in the awesome pattern when machined across it's layers. I hope to eventually try other types of wood and get just as good results as these turned out!\u00a0\nThe USB port installed will be a USB-C port, as this standard will be the most commonly used in the forseeable future, and will be located on the short end of the charger.\nThe arrows in the image below indicate on what side the USB port will be placed.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally, I will have every charger marked with a serial number SPECIFICALLY for this kickstarter, so these will be distuinguishable from any subsequent follow ups!\n\nThe name\nTo embody the project I wanted to come up with a name which would be able to describe what it was, without being too on the nose. I came up with combining two pieces of Japanese to form the name.\u00a0\n\"Ketai\" means cell- or mobile phone, and \"Ki\" can be written with the characters for tree, device or spirit. And when combining the former and latter part I had found my name!\n\nA little backstory\nI went into this project with the intention of designing a charger which I felt would be a better result than the ones I've seen.\u00a0\n\nAfter having scribbled a bit in borders and scraps filled with other work, I got onto using one of the most useful tools in my designing arsenal. The access to CAD software. The result of my first attempt into making a charger which would fit my phone, and hold it there with a recessed area might look very familiar!\n\n\n\n\n\nNow after the 3D model satisfied me, I got to translating this information to paper to make my first prototype!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first prototype I made started life as a stack of wooden slats. I cut those into smaller segments, glued them together and then cut and sanded the whole into a workable piece. (I was hoping the irregularities in the wood would create a nice pattern!). After that I went to work with my trusty dremel tool to cut out the shape of the segments to match the drawings. And while I wasn't fast nor totally accurate, it did actually work. You can see the actual circuitry for the prototype used in one of the pictures, which was later fitted inside. Also my first attempt at treating the wood was with a varnish. However I wasn't satisfied with that and have decided to use staining as a result!\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this picture, you can see the result of the first attempt (Which was mostly proving that the charger would work fine through wood). And while it's not the prettiest, and the varnishing attempt didn't work out too well, I'm still quite happy I made it, as it was one of my first steps in this undertaking.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next prototype was much closer to the eventual design I decided upon. It is handmade too, but like the first prototype very much functional. The body is made from angled segments of wood with a flat top for the center area. It also has a small window which lights up blue when a phone is charging on it! However this may still change in the final design. It has the dimensions of the normal sized charger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving handcrafted two functional prototypes, I felt so energized I tried my hand at making a few more designs. And as you can see below I've had quite some fun doing so! You can recognize which ones I've picked for this campaign, however maybe there is some future design I can work out too.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter having made these extra designs I went searching for the possibility to machine the chargers from a single piece. And as it turned out I could! The resulting prototypes you can see here are the results from having them machined at a CNC shop, and I must say I was extremely excited to see the results. It was also really cool to see how the layers of multiplex revealed themselves because of the machining. This was the chargers when I got them from the shop, before the finishing and staining.\n\n\n\n\n\nI couldn't pass up the chance to line up a set of tries to show some of the evolution!\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the look of the wood once it has been sanded and stained multiple times!\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nImage and style\nNow with the chargers so far along, I still needed something of a logo. Having thought of the name, I was given a few suggestions. Which I eventually narrowed down to two choices. And to find which one would best suit the chargers, had them engraved into wood, in a similar fashion as the serial numbers will eventually be!\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd for making this project look good, some nice pictures! The results should be recognizable in the various shots used in the presentation itself.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShipping and taxes\nSadly even over here we aren't exempt from the increased cost of shipping things across the globe. I've tried to find the most reasonable shipping I could find. As the constraint here for a small package is 2 kg, multiple chargers will not increase the cost up to this point. An extra heavy package will sadly jump the cost.\nI will ensure that every package has a track & trace code when shipped. As this in included in the pledge.\nPlease do note that I take no responsbility for any import duties or fees which may occur in your country.\u00a0\n\nThank you all so much for reading up to this point and I hope I've had the chance to show you what this project is all about. Either which way, thank you so much for your time and I wish everyone a lovely time!"

I am a young entrepreneur inspired by promoting technology and employment at the same time. \u00a0Our mission is to connect everyday people to a marketplace of skilled freelancers to help consumers with odd-jobs and errands.\nChoreable is the easy way to take care of all your chores from cleaning, handyman work, moving, lawn care, deliveries of groceries, and dinner from your favourite restaurant!\nWe want to create an easy to use platform that you can instantly book services with freelancers that are verified. You can choose the individual by reviews, skills, and price. You can schedule when it works best for you and you can chat, pay, tip, and review all through one platform.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe want to be a marketplace providing opportunities to people around the world to earn a living by connecting with others in their community. We are working to generate change and we are committed to playing a role in increasing underrepresented populations in the tech industry.\nEveryday work is important, but it also is time consuming. Get more done in less time with Choreable.\n\n\n\n\n\nHOW WILL FUNDING BE USED:\nWe are currently asking for a pledge total of $2883 CDN to support Phase 1 of our project's development. All the funds collected will be used in their entirety to carry out the necessary platform, marketing and acquire equipment to be able to carry out the work and hire employees to work with this great project."

Let yourself be guided by this longing, carrying a sense of incompleteness that is inevitably amplified in a country like Italy, so rich in artistic, architectural and natural wonders.\nBeauty is a quest for sense, a catalyst of metaphysical explorations, the foundation of those intangible values forming our culture. Beauty is the ultimate creative force, the core element or every timeless creation. Beauty goes hand in hand with right and fair. These concepts are part of the same equation and there is no exception to this rule. Therefore beauty is objective, never subjective. claiming the opposite would be rather presumptuous.\nThe stories we present in this book will provide you with a hands-on knowledge of things that take a lifetime to discover.

        "Text": "Why do we still get paper receipts?\nWhen you purchase merchandise at retailers such as Target, CVS, Best Buy, Walmart, etc. you always leave with a paper receipt longer than a trip to the moon which more often than not you immediately throw away or lose. Did you ever think to yourself why in the digital age we are in today do we still use paper receipts to keep track of our purchases and for returns. Not only is it inconvenient when we try and return an item we purchased but it is also bad for the environment.\u00a0Every year it is estimated that the United States ALONE consumes 3.3 million trees and 9 billion gallons of water, while emitting 4.6 billion pounds of CO2 in the process of paper receipt production. These chemicals don't just stay on the paper, but can make their way into our bodies as a result of simply handling receipt paper.\u00a0\n\nMy idea to change it all!\nWhat I would like to build here is an app that will allow generate and allow you to scan a barcode on your phone and get your receipt sent to it digitally to that app. Then from there be able to organize it by either store name, dollar amount, date, etc. within the app itself. I am not looking to create receipts within the app I want them to be digitally sent to the app just like how they are sent to your email at times. Your email gets too clogged this way and not every retailer provides that option. In the future I wish to have app features such as retailer coupons which can be claimed and clipped within the app. Many of these features will streamline your checkout process saving you time and money and helping the environment by cutting down on paper, ink and water waste. \u00a0\n\nMy Goal!\nMy hope and idea is to partner with the major box store retailers and credit card companies to gain access to the stores transaction detail and allow it to be uploaded right to the app and skip the paper receipt.\n\nWhy Receipts are Terrible\nReceipts come from the lowest quality paper, and the ink may begin to fade few hours after printing in some cases. In many instances, the thermal ink will start falling off with time, and you will be left with a blank paper, so again why are receipts not digital?\n\nThermal paper uses heat from a printer head to make letters and numbers appear; no ink is used. This process requires the addition of bisphenol A (BPA) or bisphenol S (BPS) in their \"free form\", which means that the chemicals are not bound to the paper or polymerized. The chemicals can easily transfer to anything a receipt touches your hand, the money in your wallet, or even the groceries in your shopping bag.\nBPA and BPS are known hormone disruptors that can affect brain development, heart, lung and prostate health, mammary glands, and reproductive abilities. They can be transferred from fingers to the mouth via food, or absorbed directly through the skin when held.\nWorst part about these receipts is you can't even recycle them they must be throw away in the garbage!!\n\nApps and retailer with the right ideas\nSure a few retailers allow you to have your receipt sent via email such as CVS but this clogs your inbox making it difficult to filter and sort through all the junk you may have.\u00a0\nAll the apps currently available on the app store do not offer this service I wish and hope to bring to our society. The only services these apps provide are for you to take a picture and upload it after you've gotten your receipts or create a new receipt to give to a customer in exchange for goods or service. All these apps have very low star reviews and are old and outdated. I want to digitalize the receipt process for every single cash register there is at all businesses across America and then the world!\u00a0\n\nPlease help by donating today, if you aren't able to donate don't worry because the 2nd best thing is to share this! If you have any helpful insightful ideas then contact me as well.\u00a0"

        "Text": "\n\n\n\n\nHow clean is your home really? Does it smell or feel stuffy sometimes? You've probably experienced bad odours at some point in your house. PURRAIR has been created to solve those problems most effectively and efficiently. Discover the life-changing magic of PURRAIR!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy choose PURRAIR over other products in the market? Unlike the other existing air purifiers, PURRAIR is permanent, convenient, simple, and most importantly, different. Regardless of the environment or situation, PURRAIR will get the job done and outperform competitors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeriodic Spraying - the spray type air fresheners we are so familiar with, for example, Febreeze, do not have a long-lasting effect. \u00a0The effects dissipate a few minutes after spraying and bad odors return. PURRAIR is different from those temporary relief sprays. PURRAIR will refresh the air by eliminating harmful substances floating in the air.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most impressive features of PURRAIR is that it barely makes any noise. While it has an impeccable performance, the fan embedded in the device allows for a soundless performance. Individuals or pets sensitive to noise will feel at ease while PURRAIR is doing its job.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPURRAIR does not require any replacement. Therefore there's no additional or hidden cost. \u00a0PURRAIR's plasma unit is permanent, so you won't need any replacement filters. Improve your air quality and let your savings grow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPURRAIR's compact size and flat design make it portable. You can drop it into your backpack and take it anywhere with you. Bring the heavy performance with you while keeping your backpack light. Make your work desk an air-safe zone or board a flight without any worries about cross-contamination. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConventional air purifiers cannot reach hidden corners such as shoe cupboards and pantries. PURRAIR's magnetic installation and high-capacity internal battery make it ideal for taking control of these difficult to reach spaces. Let PURRAIR work behind doors and improve the air quality everywhere.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPURRAIR's simple and minimal aesthetics are designed to fit all interior spaces, from mid-century to victorian style. We have prepared six beautiful colors so that you can choose the right fit for your home and office.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hidden LED indicator shows the battery status. You can use it with the USB adapter connected or disconnected. The internal high-capacity battery will provide up to 20 hours of disconnected use. It only takes two and a half hours to charge fully.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimply touch and enjoy clean air. If odors are severe then touch one more time for the boost mode. The fan will increase its speed up to 8,500 rpm and complete the difficult task of severe odor removal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo need to replace anything and no need to wash anything. You just need to swab the plasma pins every three weeks, which only takes 30 seconds. A cotton swab and 30 seconds every three weeks are all you need for maintenance.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChemical residue can be harmful to self-grooming pets and curious children. Unlike spray-type odor removers, PURRAIR leaves no residue while cleansing the air. The Ozone occurrence rate is only 0.008 ppm, significantly lower than the FDA's requirement of \"No more than 0.05\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to COVID-19, problems such as shipping and logistics around the world continue to grow. Due to the shipping crisis, customers' parcels are often lost or delayed, and some of them are not being tracked. Purrit has negotiated with several carriers to resolve this issue. Finally, we have decided to ship all packages via air transport. To all customers who purchase PURRAIR on Kickstarter, we ship the product by air courier to all regions of the world. This shipping method is one of the fastest. It takes 2-5 days for these flights to arrive at the customer's destination. It also provides accurate tracking information until the customer receives the product. Customers will be able to receive the product within a week after the production of the PURRAIR production is completed. \u00a0All staff will do their best to not only deliver but also advance the announced production schedule. \u00a0PURRIT is made up of engineers with extensive experience in development, design, software, production and delivery.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Our Story\u00a0\nClickTrim started out with a few guys with big ideas to revolutionize the trim industry. Major industry suppliers have tried (and do) offer \u2018pre-finished\u2019 products, however, these products still require effort cover up nails / miter cuts resulting in additional time and money. Our product is constructed in a way that allows an individual to avoid any nails in the prefinished product by using our two-part base track & finished trim.\n\n\n\nPrototypes & Designs\n\n\n\nThe design transformed from paper sketches to various 3D designs, ultimately working with MDF to test the designs until the solution was redesigned and perfected. The product is now ready to be shared with the world as we have the internal capabilities to scale up production and patents(or pending) & trademarks in place.\n\n\n\nRedesigned Gripping Base Track\n\n\n\nThe founder has over 20 years in plumbing, electrical and building experience, he has worked in both the commercial and residential space. His entrepreneurial drive has built up companies, employed up to 60 employees and has made his mark in every community that he has called home.\n\n\n\nTest Production\n\n\n\nThe co-owner has both construction and managerial experience. With over 10 years of construction experience and 15 years of CPA, CA experience in strategic, management and governance experience.\n\n\n\nInstalling ClickTrim\n\n\n\nAt ClickTrim, we understand that teamwork is essential for every successful business and we have established a network of partners in marketing, legal, business mentoring and distribution to ensure that the company is ready to achieve the goals outlined below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.

        "Text": "\nWhy do we need capital and what will it be used for?\nThe purpose of this fund raising project is to generate sufficient capital that will primarily go towards the pre-launch & launch app-marketing campaigns of Goal Symmetry (the product). There's certainly no use in having a great product if nobody knows about it. We've already consulted with a few of the top app marketing companies so that we could understand what they'd be able to deliver for us and what their services would cost. The reason we do not plan on trying to do all the marketing ourselves is because it's simply not our area of expertise. So, ideally we'd like to outsource that work to the professionals.\n\nHalf the battle has already been won!\nThe good news is, the first production version of the app has already been created, thoroughly tested and been approved by both Apple App Store & Google Play Store. But until we've been able to run several app marketing campaigns to build interest, we do not plan on prematurely launching the app.\n\nWhat's special about this particular app and why would people want to use it?\nThe discipline of setting goals, many would agree, is an important one to have especially among those who are, or are on their way to becoming, massively successful. However, why is it that so many people don't set goals? Our understanding, is that firstly, it takes TIME and secondly, it forces you to stop and think about what you really want and then plan out how you're going to make it actually happen.\u00a0\nWell, nobody can do your thinking for you, but there are most definitely ways to make the planning steps and progress-measuring along the way a lot easier.\u00a0\nGoal Symmetry is unique (at least until the competitors catch up) in the goal setting sphere, as the focus is geared toward the documentation of your journey, not just setting and achieving your actual goals. So, when creating goals for yourself or your business, you're able to easily create/edit notes attached to any goal, let alone all the other cool things such as multiple ways to track/measure your progress, set and check off milestones (or sub-goals if you prefer) and more. Each goal you create, has all you need attached to it - stored in a database that can be accessed from any of your Apple or Android mobile/tablet devices. Additionally, the architecture was carefully designed with the understanding of probably the most highly recommended and successful goal-setting methodology. We mostly want to take the pain out of setting goals and help make the process as easy and helpful as possible, because we know the power and value of the discipline of goal setting.\nNo more notepads or journal books that will inevitably get lost or misplaced overtime along with all your important goals and notes you've made. The digital way is definitely the way to go. All your carefully planned and thought-of ideas, goals & ambitions will be all in one place, easily accessible (by you), backed up as well as username & password protected.\n\nWho are we?\nWe're a brand new startup company called Sagacious Apps Limited. We're based in the UK and we're in the business of productivity app development and solving problems.\u00a0\n\nWhat else can we (the backers) hope to expect in the future for Goal Symmetry?\nGreat question! Without divulging too much information right here, there are plenty of plans and ideas in the works for future updates. We don't want to give away the juicing stuff for our competitors to steal, but we can at least say that there's a lot of room for growth such as a web app version and a more business appropriate package that we plan to add. So, hopefully I won't be too optimistic to say that if the project gets over-funded, we can put those funds to good use and great upgrades.\n\nLastly, we can't forget to attribute the free resources used to present Goal Symmetry to you here.\nProject Image Template:\nhttps://previewed.app/template/A190B347\nProject Video Template:\nhttps://previewed.app/video\nMusic Used In Project Video:\nhttps://royaltybeat.com/get/free-music-library/"

        "Text": "Who am I?\nHello, my name is Sidney! I am an entrepreneur at heart who loves to create products that fill a direct purpose, whether that purpose be to bring joy or to solve a problem! This will be my 2nd Kickstarter launched and hopefully just as successful as my 1st!\nIn my free time when I'm not working my day job or spending time with my family, I love to golf during the summer and play hockey during the winter as anyone in Minnesota normally will do. I love to tinker on different product designs or ideas that come to mind and over the last few years I've spent a lot of time learning about cryptocurrency.\nWhat do I plan on making and why?\nI plan on manufacturing my own custom made enclosure through a process called injection molding, this process helps produce things as cheap and quick as possible! In this Kickstarter I will only be offering the meter lid and meter box for purchase in single, bulk and reseller quantities as listed in the pledge options.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Drok Voltmeter Display & L6-30R are not included on Kickstarter!\nWhy create this product? Well, I have been seeking a way to know my accurate electrical usage in live-time for my mining rigs? I'll give you a bit of background; crypto miners need to know their electrical usage so they can measure real costs from electricity and better gage their return on investment and what they're profiting.\nAfter determining my problem and searching far and wide online, I found the DROK Voltmeter Display to be the best product for the job in terms of measuring electrical usage and the L6-30R for 30amp, 240v electrical use. After I found the items I needed to help me successful measure my power usage, I couldn't house either of them!\n\u00a0Check out the initial models below!\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWith both the meter and plug, the new problem was that I could not find a quick solution to house both items - I found some 3D printed options but I didn't have time to wait the 3 months for the product to be produced from someone online. After a bit of designing and testing around the two products I came to the conclusion that I would be able to produce this enclosure as shown above without any issues at all.\nWhat\u2019s my plan, and what\u2019s my schedule?\nWith my background in injection molding and experience sourcing products I am able to offer a product that can be created in masses but still at a low price. My hopes are to not only solve a product demand but a supply demand as well, when you order from me this will be delivered in days, not weeks at a reasonable price.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you back my project today - together we will make this product become a reality as early as November 2021 as shown in my timeline above! I have the parts secured through the manufactures directly so I can offer the lowest pricing possible, injection molds are ready to be cut so they can begin filling with plastic, and the logistics are in place to get this into your hands days after being produced in North Carolina!\nWhat's my budget for this project?\nAs shown in the chart below, I breakdown exactly where the Kickstarter funds (if funded successfully) need to go in order to make this product become a reality. Through Kickstarter I do not plan on making a profit but making a product become available to produce and provide to you, the initial backers!\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can I support this project?\nWe need backers to support our Kickstarter! Our Meter Lid and Meter Box is sold as a set as shown below for the low price of $35, this pricing is only available to the first 300 units sold, after that it will resume it's normal MSRP of $45 per unit.\nBulk Options Are Available But In Limited Quantities Shown.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "Text": "\n\n\n\n\nOpen bike is a small, foldable electric micro scooter.\u00a0\nI created it for myself but I'd love to share it with you, because we all have right to clean, safe, cheap and sustainable transport.\nYou can use it to move from place to place or just for fun.\nThanks to it's shape it is safe and comfortable.\nSimple construction allows you to built it by yourself with cost below 300 Euro (final price depends on your configuration and component prices in your country).\nExperience the freedom of mobility with a scooter built by you and customizied to your needs thanks to Open Architecture.\u00a0Open Architecture means that you can adapt it to your needs and use the components that best meet your requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan't find anything on the market that suits your needs?\u00a0\nNo chance to buy anything due to pandemic period? No problem - do it yourself!\n\nThe goal of this campaign is to create video tutorials that will allow you to build it yourself.\u00a0You will receive all documentation, all knowledge and all necessary CAD files to build it.\n\nYou will learn a lot and you will be proud of your vehicle. You will see how simple it is.\n\nYou can modify and apply your changes according to your needs - different wheels sizes, different battery capacity, you can use different motor type or even change frame shape. The mounting of the saddle is adapted to standard spacing, so you can easily use any model.\nYou can decide how much you will spent on this scooter. You can significantly reduce costs if you already have some parts - you can use them with ease.\n\nYou can achieve up to 40km on single charge - depends on how many battery cells you will use.\u00a0The battery is easily removable.\nMaximum speed depends on you final configuration (motor power and wheel size). Currently it is up to 30km/h\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe entire frame is easily adaptable to any changes that come to your mind.\nNote that in this type of project, the key is to adjust the proportions of the vehicle so that it is neither too big nor too small, and the position we take behind the wheel is as comfortable as possible. So if you would like to refine these sizes yourself, you have to spend a lot of time on it and make a lot of tests.\nSo if you want to cut corners - I've already done it for you.\nNow anyone can take advantage of my work and build their vehicle based on the documentation provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVehicle can be constructed without any special tools, such as welders, migomats, etc.\nIt is important, because not everyone has such devices and not everyone is able to use them. Moreover, these operations are rather time-consuming and this generates costs. Therefore, only bolted connections were used in this construction.\nIt does not even require welding to the battery. Thanks to my special design you can built battery with ease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-standard parts, for example all connecting elements, folding mechanism, etc. can be done with 3D printing and laser cutting.\nYou can easily order elements from 3D printing everywhere for very little money and probably some of you also have such printers at home.\nLaser cutting is also affordable and the services are easy available.\nYou can also completely abandon laser cutting and cut each sheet and drill yourself.\n\nEven if you feel that construction is not for you, you can still support this project.\u00a0\nWith your support I will provide better documentation and then you can ask someone else to build it for you.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Current specification:\n- weight: 11,4kg\n- top speed 30km/h\n- electric motor: BLDC 250W\u00a0\n- front wheel 12 inch\u00a0\n- rear wheel 8 inch with hub motor\n\nWhen recording tutorial, the scooter will be built from scratch based on new parts to show that all parts fits together perfectly. All parts will be 3D printed and laser cut. You will get 10 to 15 video tutorials and \u00a0more than 50 CAD files, all dimensions and a list of parts to buy.\nIf it there is over funding - some new options will be also tested and recorded - different motors and wheels, different controllers etc.\n\nThis license is for personal and non-commercial use only. If you want to sell this product, ask for a separate license - it's very cheap."

Because the pandemic put in front of our eyes not only the professionalism of every healthcare staff but, first and foremost, that we are not only nurses but also human beings with the goal to guarantee the health and wellness of everyone.\n\nThe pandemic has brought under a new light the role of nurses placing in the public eyes of our communities the existing criticality of this profession. In fact they are the first getting in contact with anyone in need of health care and they are the first encounters in the hospitals.\n\n\n\n\nBrand\n\n\n\nNurselife is a team of nurses with a keen to grow this profession.\nOur mission is to facilitate the learning curve, studying and preparing for the exams by contributing to improve the quality of health care. Within the app, you can find everything you need in regards to nursing. The topics covered are:\n- Basic and advanced nursing.\n- Critical care.\n- Maternal and Infant care.\n- Surgical care.\n- Management.\n\n\n\nScreeshot\n\n\n\n\nThe objectives of Nurselife are:\n1. Make available all sort of informative material for all the Italian nurses and not only, by translating to English, French and Spanish;\n2. Provide a positive change in the nurse role also from a social and cultural point of view;\n3. Simplify clinical care practice via an easy-to-use tool and clarity of contents;\n4. Help in review or preparation for university exams or for work.\n\n\n\nT-shirt\n\n\n\n\n\nNurselife, therefore, looks to the future with the respect and the teachings of a noble past which, across all its history, has shown the ability to shape the healthcare assistance, to manage it and to point it towards perspectives and solutions which they have been recognized only after years and years from their enunciations.\nAnd, as Florence Nightingale used to say, a nurse who, in the past, was already living in the future: \u201cCaring is an art; and, if it is considered as such, requires a total devotion and a hard preparation, as per any work from a painter or sculptor; with the only difference being as to work not on a canvas or on icy marbles but on the human body.\u201d.\nDo you study nursing? Are you freshly graduated? Or do you simply need a quick review while working? Nurselife is the app for you!! Help us growing and spreading all our knowledge not only for Italy but for the entire world.\n\n\n\n\nMug\n\n\n\nThe app is already available in Italian:\n\n\n\nAvailable for Android and Ios\n\n\n"

In the digital and modern world of service availability, we solve the problem that the user finds the desired handyman at a given moment through the application and solves a problem as quickly as possible. Here comes our application, which through geolocation at a given moment gives available workers and reviews of the same, history of their completed works and the reactions of the users of the application. The customers have the opportunity to choose the most suitable ones. The deal is settled within the same day, compared to the current long-term wait for repairs. FixIT offers a better relationship between the supply and demand of consumers and workers through an online system, as well as price competitiveness (wider choice of service).\n\nSecret Sauce: It currently takes a very long time to find a worker. Thus, the possibility of repair is extended and the user is in an uncomfortable situation of wasting their precious time and money. Here comes our application with the code used by various other applications that contain the geolocation and user database. It gives us a quick and easy way to choose the best and most affordable worker, while on the other side it gives the worker the choice to accept or reject the job application. This process improves the entire supply/demand relationship, speeds up the process and saves everyone time and care in finding handymen and consumers. Our main goal is to connect and save time for both parties.\n\nUsers: Since repairs cover a wide range of jobs, our customers can be anyone who needs a specific home repair or construction service. The application is based on the smooth connection between consumers and handymen, where a quality and sustainable business model would be provided through a quality service fee model (advertising, monthly subscription or low fee when charging for the service provided). The goal is to cover a larger international market and become a global application for mediation between handyman and consumer. The target group is any person who needs repair.\n\nSpread the Word\nThank you for your support! We hope you love FixIT as much as we do! \u00a0We would be forever in your debt if you would share FixIT with your audience to help this project come to life!\n\nShare FixIT on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and TikTok.\n\nhttps://fixitapp.medium.com/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/fixitapp.co/\nhttps://twitter.com/fixitapp_co"

The name was inspired by the recommended hydration goal; 8 cups. Once we started testing pre-existing methods of hydration track we noticed accuracy and convenience had not been given enough thought. This is when we set to work on designing 8bottle.\n\nAfter going through a rigorous testing period we found a combination of features that made a great smart bottle. This meant designing sipping verification technology that detects human lips for accuracy, LED display and wireless charging for everyday convenience as well as a rugged waterproof exterior so this was the only water bottle you would ever need.\n\nWe want to thank you for considering backing our project!"

        "Text": "\n\n\nI2C GPIO expander, fan header, OLED screen? Just the tip of the iceberg!\n\n\nThe JC Pro Macro 2 is a USB keyboard device that emulates keystrokes and mouse movements, saving you precious computer interface time. A swappable Arduino-programmable ATMega32U4 Pro Micro (clone) powers it, and the board provides GPIO/I2C breakout pins for unlimited tinkering and customization.\n\n\u00a0Why Use a Macro Pad/Deck/Aux Input?\nThe keyboard/mouse combination is a fantastic general purpose tool for interfacing with a computer, which has nominally done the job for decades. But it wasn't made just for you and the way you work with a computer. The JC Pro Macro 2 adds an extra input device that can be customized to your liking for a huge productivity boost!\nUsing the JC Pro Macro 2, without any add-ons, one could implement:\n\nKeyboard combinations with a single keystroke (e.g. ctl-alt-insertkeyhere)\ninput lots o' text with a single button\n\u00a0Media control (literally crank up the volume via rotary encoder)\nProgram and change key functionality using the Arduino IDE\u00a0\n8 main input keyswitches with programmable lights for each, plus programmable under-lighting\nNo software installation needed on host computer for standard operation. Plug in and go!\n\n\n\n\nDid I mention lights?\n\n\n...but you'll find many of those features in other macro pads. What's unique to the JC Pro Macro 2 is that it's:\nBuilt for Tinkering, Making, Experimentation\nThe JC Pro Macro 2 features a number of unique hackable features, including:\n\n\n\nControl a fan with your macro pad!?!\n\n\n\n\u00a0GPIO pins broken out, including I2C pins for virtually unlimited control of external devices\nATMega32U4 Pro Micro (clone) controller. Socketed for easy swap-out. Should be able to swap out for Pro Micro footprint boards like the nice!nano or Elite-C, but this has not been tested.\nIndividually addressable lighting for each keyswitch, along with underlighting for awesome ambient effect.\nCan be used independently of a computer as a standalone controller\nOptional OLED display\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGPIO Pins Broken out + additional SDA/SCL not shown\n\n\nNotably, the device is an enhanced-features sequel to the original JCPM, which has been successfully built and sold here.\nWhy I Love My JCPM2\nI made the first JC Pro Macro, as well as other experimental devices that came before, in a large part because I wanted a rotary controller for my computer. After many iterations, and inspiration from others, I finally have something that I'm willing to put up on Kickstarter.\u00a0\nBut why do I like mine? Why will you find yours indispensable? First off, being able to literally crank up tunes with an encoder knob and play/pause/skip songs with dedicated hotkeys is much better than mouse-based alternatives.\nI also personally love using this for editing video in Final Cut Pro X. The customizable shortcuts let me make quick work cutting clips free of sub-par content, and the encoder allows me to advance clips frame-by-frame. In fact, I produced this project's Kickstarter video using the JCPM 2. How recursive!\nFinally, being able to control the 5V PC-style cooling fan at the touch of a button is much fun. I can start, stop, or adjust a cooling breeze with a simple keystroke!\n\n\n\n8 extra keyswitches ready to do your bidding!\n\n\nOf course, you could use it for just about anything else: gaming, robotics control, home automation, video production, music production, CAD modeling, EDA, EDM (whether dance music, or discharge machining), video conferencing...\n\n\n\n\u00a0In the above video, friend and prototype tester Pat Regan shows off some amazing Linux functionality: changing its lighting based on the program in focus, modifying external lighting, and working on video in DaVinci Resolve. Below, he's even shows off another JCPM set up as a CNC pendant!\n\n\n\n\u00a0Much of what he's showing in the first video is beyond my Linux/home automation know-how\u2013and will require user setup\u2013but it demonstrates just what is possible with this hardware, specialized for tinkering and experimentation.\u00a0\nExample firmware will be available, and the current (standard) version is found on GitHub. The device's functionality is still under development, and a nascent community is developing around this little board that you can be a part of!\nHackable Design and Structure\nMy background slants towards mechanical design and electronics, and I've put a large amount of time into developing what I consider a great looking and flexible platform:\n\n\n\nIt's all abou that base\n\n\nHackable Electronics:\n\n\u00a0Pro Micro board socketed underneath the main circuit board, allowing more real estate for controls, while still being easily swappable.\nPower, ground, and GPIO pins broken out on board for limitless expansion. 4 power/ground pins are configurable via solder bridges for easy mounting of accessories on headers. Another GPIO pin and power/gnd is planned\nMode and reset buttons can be mounted on top or below PCB as convenient when self-assembled.\nSpace for optional I2C pull-up resistors.\n\nStructural Elements Include:\n\nClear acrylic base\nStandoffs/screws\nOptional acrylic switch plate\n\nThe knob comes in two formats:\u00a0\n\nplastic\u2013functional, but basic\nEnhanced knurled and anodized aluminum, to look and feel spectacular.\n\nDevelopment Process\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThis isn't my first try at a macro keyboard. In fact, as seen here, a simple volume control knob eventually morphed into a 3D-printed device. This became a PCB-based original JCPM device that I have successfully used and sold, before settling on the JCPM2 design. Since deciding on this 8-button form factor, it has gone through multiple revisions.\n\n\n\nKeep your computer on, even in the dark with Rando Mouse!\n\n\nTested!\nAs of this writing, the device has been tested to work with Windows, Macintosh, Linux, and Raspberry Pi systems in a variety of situations.\n\n\u00a0Volume, media control, etc (Windows, Mac, Linux)\n\u00a0Mouse jiggler: to keep computer active (Mac, Windows)\n\u00a0Video Editing: Final Cut Pro X (Macintosh), DaVinci Resolve (Linux)\n\u00a0CNC: control pendant: cncjs (Raspberry Pi Zero)\n\u00a0MIDI Interface (without computer)\n\u00a0PWM Fan control (standalone)\n\u00a0Rotary gaming control (slither.io) (Mac)\n\nOf course, this is really just scratching the surface of what's possible with it. I'm looking forward to seeing what people do with it!\nProgramming and customization are via the Arduino IDE, and it can theoretically run QMK firmware for custom layouts without Arduino knowledge. Preliminary testing with QMK has been successful, and full functionality can hopefully be developed further.\nMeet the Creator\nI'm Jeremy Cook\u2013The \"JC\" in \"JC Pro Macro,\" an engineer who simply can't help making new contraptions. After several auxiliary input devices, I'm proud to present this one for crowdfunding. You can see more of what I make and do on:\n\nYouTube\nTwitter\njeremyscook.com\n\nAlso, a big thanks to those that helped make this possible:\n\nPat Regan, inspiration and product testing\nG\u00fcrkan Dogan, and Physics Anonymous for Kickstarter and product advice\nThe folks at Tampa Hackerspace for inspiration, advice, and encouragement\nThe Butter What? Discord folks for lots of input on the project\nVideo music by midierror\u00a0\nAnd many more!\n\nWhy Can I Deliver?\nWhile this is my first Kickstarter, this is not my first time selling custom electronics online. I've delivered well over 200 items from my highly rated Tindie store.\nAdditionally, I spent a decade in manufacturing automation, making me intimately familiar with the processes needed to create many copies of one device. When in charge of manufacturing lines, failure is not an option, and I hope to bring that experience and attitude to bear here.\u00a0\nIf and when help is needed, I have a wide range of contacts that I can call upon, especially if funding and demand becomes abundant! To that end, I hope you will support this project's goal, and that I can ultimately provide you with an awesome computer input device.\nWorking Prototypes!\u00a0\n\n\n\nPull over for macro-tinkering fun!\n\n\nAfter testing the JC Pro Macro Original, along with a JCPM2 prototype for several months, I've had a chance to work with it, and morph it into something that works really well.\nPCBWay was used to manufacture the various prototype iterations of the device's main board, and has even agreed to a discount on the final product in exchange for mentioning them here. They've always delivered in a timely manner, so I'm quite confident in this aspect of the project. I also plan to use their matte black finish on the boards, which I think looks awesome.\nMore info on the JC Pro Macro Original can be found here on GitHub, and code etc that can be used with the JC Pro Macro 2 will be stored in this repository as it develops. While the prototype device is currently functional, its final form may change from what is shown here.\u00a0\nTo be clear, what is shown in the videos here is possible with the device, but much of that functionality will take external hardware and/or software to set up. You currently need to use the Arduino IDE to change key functionality around. If you enjoy that sort of thing, I think you'll love it!\nProject by Jeremy Cook Consulting LLC\nReward Notes:\n\n\u00a0Kits and Boards come with surface-mount components (LEDs) pre-soldered. Soldering in keyswitches, and encoder, and connecting GND/Power pads with solder if used will need to be done, as well as some mechanical assembly. Solder/soldering iron is not provided.\n\u00a0Assembled means that soldering of all components and standard programming will be done. For shipping reasons, there may be a few screws that need to be fastened, and/or accessories that will need to be plugged in.\n\u00a0Optional keyswitch plate option is similar to the base, but has cutouts for the keyswitches to constrain them nicely. Shown in some parts of the video.\n\u00a0Optional OLED screen can be used to display device data.\n\u00a0Normal knob will be plastic and potentially 3D-printed. Aluminum knob can also be selected as an option. Note that the color/style of both are subject to change in order to avoid any supply chain and/or fulfillment issues.\n\u00a0Keycaps will likely be a translucent design to allow light to shine through, though this is also subject to change. Very easy to swap as desired.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The idea for Ventus Home and Ventus Ion all started when I was living in Hong Kong. I realized the poor indoor air quality was affecting my 7-year-old son, so I began to research the contributing factors of indoor air pollution. I learned that in addition to outside air pollution, home scent products are a major contributor!\nSince I had expertise in developing commercial scent systems, I realized that I could combine air purification and scent diffusion to provide a better way for people to enjoy fresh air and clean scents.\nI assembled a team of scent industry experts, put pen to paper, and started working on developing Ventus Home and Ventus Ion along with safer fragrances. We came up with the world's first and only hi-performance home systems that purify the air and distribute natural fragrances throughout the home.

        "Text": "Hello,\n Imagine that you are in the middle of nature while camping, or you are walking with your family in the woods, or you live in the countryside,\n\n For you, we offer three applications for smartphone and PC that allows you with your smartphone or a simple camera or camcorder to identify in real time trees or plants.\n These applications will help your teenagers who spend their day on their smartphone to love nature!\n\n These three applications have one thing in common: there is no need to have a network so if you plan to move to a cabin in Alaska these applications will be very useful,\n These apps all have the same goal: to learn more about nature and appreciate its benefits, to show you why to preserve it.\n\n Whether you live in the city, in the country, by the sea or isolated without civilization more than a hundred milles away, the first application is made for you, it can save your life or help you to treat your little boo-boo.\n This application allows you to identify in real time medicinal plants and to give you their usefulness. Like the chelidonia which treats warts with its sap, the wild thyme or the plantain which helps to relieve respiratory problems,...\n\n Whether you are an amateur or professional gardener, the second application is for you, it identifies the diseases that can be found in a vegetable garden and gives you a solution to eradicate it. For example, mildew can be treated with horsetail manure or a mixture of baking soda and black soap...\n\n The third application is for anyone who wants to know a little more about trees, those who want to know about edible fruits or berries and also for forestry professionals\n Whether it is fruit trees or trees of our beautiful forests.\n It allows to identify trees from their leaves, their fruits or their trunk,\n For example the oak with its leaves and acorns, the hazelnut tree with its delicious nuts...\n\n These applications are compatible with Android smartphones, IOS smartphones and PCs or tablets under Windows,\n\n It will be possible to record the GPS position, this feature will be very useful to find a plant to treat you from one year to another,\n\n The names of the plants/trees will be given in English and French, but it will be possible to give your own names according to your language or customary name, via a configuration file,\n\n Garonix is a startup created in 2017 with the objective of making a revolutionary machine for the production of electronic boards with real-time recognition of the position of electronic components in vac. The project was stopped because it was too far ahead of existing technologies and in particular because of the slow learning of neural networks.\n The creator of Garonix has 20 years of experience in industry, he is an electronic engineer at the base, but has skills in mechanics, electricity, low and high level computing, so technical above all.\n We are not a big team, we could have taken a picture of a meeting of friends by giving them a jersey with the same logo as some do on this site ...\n\n If you want some particular plants/trees to appear in the first release, you can send us your request with at least 50 pictures (leaves, flower, fruit, trunk, general appearance, small, medium and large size and if there are plants/trees that look like but are not the ones you want) per plant you want\n\n Why we ask for money in Kickstarter:\n -To validate the development of the applications by asking your interest, a kind of market survey.\n -To buy a big computer to make the learning of the neural network which is very greedy in resources and time.\n The experts could tell us to use the Google servers which propose in rent by the hour of the servers to make the training, but as everyone knows Google is a trader before all, the confidentiality for Google does not mean anything, it is placed above the states and the laws...\n\n \u00a0Please note that the designer is not responsible for the use of these applications.\n The data provided will be extracted from the internet or provided by an amateur, they are given as an indication, the user is the only one responsible for the possible consequences of their uses."

What we want is a flexible solution for food 3D printing, so we create\u00a0LuckyBot - a replaceable 3D printer extruder. You can easily install it on your original 3D FDM printer, and print food in the shape you want in a\u00a0flexible & affordable\u00a0way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot everyone could cook like a Michelin star chef, but what if we bring the 3D print technology to your kitchen? You can print all the exquisite desserts with your 3D printer, easy same as you use it to print filament.\nThat's why we create LuckyBot. It is compatible with most of the FDM 3D printers on the market. Just take a few minutes to install, then you can have a food 3D printer at a small cost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuckyBot is designed with a perfect size that is enough to fit most of FDM 3D printers on the market and utilize the printing size of the original 3D printer to allow you to print bigger size models.\nOnly 675g weight makes it fit your FDM 3D printer and not exceeding the limits of the motor's capacity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrosted texture shell\n\n\n\n\n\n3D Logo\n\n\n\n\n\nDigital Screen Display\n\n\n\n\n\nMagnetic Temperature Control Door and High-Precision Screw\n\n\n\n\n\nMetal Plunger\n\n\n\n\n\nStainless Steel Nozzle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. \u00a0Remove the original extruder\n2. \u00a0Replace with LuckyBot\n3. \u00a0Connect LuckyBot and original 3D Printer\n\n\n\nLuckyBot Installation\n\n\nLuckyBot Installation Video Based On Creality Ender-3 3D Printer:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree buttons to handle temperature control, lead screw adjustment with ease, no matter you are a professional or newbie, it only needs few minutes to get started.\nAs for the software part, you can follow the same procedures as you print filament to operate LuckyBot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuckyBot supports the printing of a variety of ingredients\u00a0for any model you create, so you have more choices and more creativity. Whether it's an expensive ingredient like chocolate, or a widely available ingredients like jam, cream, mashed potato, salad sauce, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe've tested various major brands' 3D printers to make sure that LuckyBot could be installed on most of FDM 3D printers.\nLuckyBot can be installed on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes LuckyBot unique is the technology inside. With our years of development, it has better temperature system, motion control system, and advanced circuit control system. You can print more complex and precise objects than using other food printers.\n\nPrecise Temperature Control System\n\nThe temperature is the most important factor when we print food. With the advanced temperature control algorithm, we have improved the temperature control accuracy within \u00b10.5\u2103.\n\n\n\nLuckyBot Precise Temperature Control System\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Motor Control System\n\nFood is different from filament in many physical properties. We will need a better motor control system to print food with the same accuracy.\n\n\n\nLuckyBot Advanced Motor Control System\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuckyBot is designed for food printing. Safety is the priority when we design LuckyBot, and all the materials are food grade. However, to make it could be used by everyone, we have enhanced the safety in power supply and temperature control. We ensure all ingredients completely sealed and do not touch the outside world during the whole printing process.\n\n\nAuto stop\n\nLuckyBot will automatically stop heating when open the door.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLower temperature\n\nUnlike the normal FDM 3D printers, which use filament as materials, needing a higher temperature to print, LuckyBot works under a much lower temperature (\u226440\u2103 ).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuckyBot Printing Videos:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Safety\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Certificates of LuckyBot\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSketch 1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCAD Drawing 2.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3D Model Design 3.1\n\n\n\n\n\n3D Model Design 3.2\n\n\n\n\n\nIterations of Structural Design  4.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuckyBot Standard Edition\n\n\n\n\n\nLuckyBot Standard Edition Unpacking List\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFounded in 2014, with the focus on education, food, scientific research, and manufacturing, Wiiboox has been always committed to be a global leading supplier for 3D printing integrated solutions.

Serial communication - RS-485 is the dominant choice, due to its ability to support multiple devices with excellent noise immunity at long distances.\n2. Digital inputs and outputs - From find simple switches, contacts and pushbuttons, to any circuit which can be powered by a relay.\n3. Analog inputs and outputs - Temperature, pressure, humidity, level, position, light and other sensors. Motors, linear and rotary actuators, and many many other devices have analog inputs and outputs. The industry standards are 0-10V and 4-20mA current loops.\nRaspberry Pi is a powerful and inexpensive programming platform, but it cannot connect to the physical world without additional hardware.\u00a0\nThis project brings to Raspberry Pi all the common interfaces needed to connect to the automation world:\n\nOne RS485 serial port\nOne PWM output capable of driving \u00a0a 5VDC/100mA motor\nFour optically isolated contact closure inputs\nTwo relays capable of driving 8A and 24V loads with LED status\nOne 0-10V input and output\nOne 4-20mA input and output\nOn-board push-button\nFour general purpose LEDs\n\n\nNode-RED Programming\nNode-RED is a programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services in new and interesting ways. It provides a browser-based editor that makes it easy to design flows using nodes from a large library covering a wide range of automation tasks.\nLearning Kit native Node-RED nodes included in the repository make it easy to interface with the hardware.\nLearning Card Block Diagram\n\n\n\nI/O Learning Kit Block Diagram\n\n\nCard Layout\n\n\n\nBoard Layout\n\n\nPower Supply\nThe Learning Kit Card needs 5V/50mA to operate with the relays off, or 200mA with both relays on. It is powered from the Raspberry Pi through the GPIO connector. \u00a0A Raspberry Pi power supply able to provide minimum 3A is recommended.\nRS485 Communication\nThe Card contains a standard RS485 transceiver which can be accessed by the serial port of the Raspberry Pi. MODBUS protocol can be run on Raspberry Pi to access industry standard sensors and actuators.\nPluggable Connectors\nPluggable connectors ease connecting the card to external devices. \u00a0All the connector plugs are included in your kit.\nDisplay LEDs\nNine LEDs on the bottom edge of the card show you the status of the inputs and outputs. The leftmost LED shows when the power is connected to the board.\nThe next two LEDs, labeled IN1 and IN3, show the status of the corresponding opto-isolated digital inputs.\nThe middle four LEDs are general purpose. They can be connected in software to show the status of any input or output. They can also be programmed to light at a certain input or output level. For example, you can learn how to turn on a LED when a temperature reaches a threshold. You can also blink a led slower when a temperature is relatively low, and faster as it approaches a preset limit.\nThe two rightmost LEDs are routed to the corresponding relays and show when the relay coil is activated.\n0-10V Input and Output\nZero to 10V Input can be used to sense voltage levels from devices such as thermistors, humidity sensors, or photoresistors. Zero to 10V output can be used for actuating industry standard devices such as lighting controller.\n4-20mA current loop Input and Output\nWidely used industry standard 4-20mA current loops can be used to control remote devices over long distances with high noise immunity.\nPush Button\nA pushbutton is provided to be able to add manual input to any system. The button can also be used by Node-RED or other Raspberry Pi programming in an arbitrary manner. \u00a0The first Tutorial lesson gives some examples from saying \"Hello World\" to sending SMS or email messages.\nPWM Motor\nThe Motor port can drive a 5V/100mA DC Motor. You can learn how to control the speed and the direction of the motor from the command line, Python or Node-Red graphical user interface.\nLast Moment Adition: Two Servo Interfaces\nSee Update #2\nWhat's in your Kit\n1.

        "Text": "What is Bubl? \u00a0\u00a0\nAvailable in 2022 for Android and iOS devices, Bubl combines intelligent discovery, next generation music content streaming and social features designed to bring fans, artists, labels and (in the future) venues from around the world together over their love of music. Think Spotify x Facebook x Patreon x Tinder (for music, not love!).\u00a0\nBubl's design means that music tracks / videos, photos, videos, events, tickets, merchandise, live streams, group chats, fan content and more are all under one 'roof'. No more switching between different applications to find that song you wanted to share with your friends, no more missing those important releases or announcements.\u00a0\nFor artists, there's a free platform for exposure to global audiences, versatility in how you make your music available and new ways to engage with your fans. On top of that, we pledge to put more in your pocket with unique, innovative revenue opportunities.\u00a0\nIt's time music fans really had something to sing about!\n\n\n\nShare your music as well as your music content with friends and followers\n\n\n\n\n\nArtist can now share they music alongside their social content\n\n\nWhy Bubl?\nLet's start with our mission statement:\n\nTo make discovering and enjoying music easier and more flexible for listeners\nTo give artists better opportunities to grow their fanbase and revenues\nTo create a safe, social space that fully supports the music community\n\nIn early 2021, Bubl was born; largely out of frustration. Frustration at the lack of a centralised app for all your music needs, and frustration with music streaming and social media platforms.\u00a0\nRegardless of what tech companies developed, finding new music, supporting your favourite artists, and connecting with fans of the same kind of music we love wasn't easy and meant switching constantly between several apps.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, artists are seeing their revenues cut, promotion only seems to go to the top 1% and social platforms have become hotbeds for hate and vitriol. And the owners of these existing platforms? Well, they seemed to be getting richer\u00a0off the very artists (and rights holders) who are often struggling to make ends meet.\nAt Bubl, we believe it's time for change; time to better look-after the music we love and cherish so much. None of us at Bubl want to be billionaires and we aren't looking to exploit artists in the pursuit of wealth. Our business model reflects this, and has been designed and created to ensure as much of the money from sales and streams goes straight back to the artist.\u00a0\nDiscovery mode generates NO revenue for Bubl; we don't charge artists or listeners, nor will you find adverts. It is simply a product born out of desire - the desire to make connecting artists and new fan bases less challenging.\u00a0\nWe have spent the past 6 months designing, specifying, and planning this project meticulously. It's hugely ambitious. But so are we.\n\nThe Bubl Team\u00a0\nHeadquartered in London, and with remote offices in Brighton and Serbia, Bubl was founded by music lovers and technology industry 'veterans' who are passionate about creating better opportunities for music fans and artists alike.\u00a0\nWith backgrounds in social gaming (EA, Warner Bros, Microsoft, Zynga), artist management, TV / broadcast and development of live music streaming platforms (one of our team built the Apple iTunes Festival streaming service) and dating / community tools, we have the tools, skills and know-how to deliver what we believe will revolutionise music streaming and social media.\u00a0\nFor more information about the leadership team, please visit our LinkedIn Page:\u00a0\nBubl on LinkedIn\u00a0\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\nAt Bubl, we chose to launch on the Kickstarter platform for two main reasons:\u00a0\n1) The Kickstarter platform gives us access to a global, engaged audience of early-adopter consumers looking for the next big thing. Our team and our supporters believe Bubl can change how we consume, share and support music for the better, and we think the Kickstarter platform is a good place to find like-minded folks.\n2) By raising funds via Kickstarter, we are able to retain our independence and engage in a meaningful way with our backers. This seems particularly relevant in the context of music, but we want to only answer to the community we pledge to serve and support; no external bias from investors or those with an interest beyond supporting ALL artists.\u00a0\n\nWhat Is The Funding For?\nThe money raised through this campaign will be used to pay for the following:\n\nDevelopmental costs - manpower in the form of our team in Serbia building Bubl\nOngoing system costs - data centre / server costs, various business systems\nOperations costs - Bubl will need legal, financial and licensing support. Not cheap!\nArtists Revenue - Bubl Credits sold translate to artist revenue as music is streamed\n\n\nBeyond our \u00a3350,000 goal, we have stretch goals which will expedite the development and release of future 'modules'. For more on this see below (Timings & Release Plan)\u00a0\n\nCore Product Features:\nBubl is built around three core features: discovery, streaming and social engagement\n\nDiscovery\n\n\n\n\nFor Listeners\nBubl\u2019s takes music fans on a journey to unearth new artists and tracks - for free.\nEnter your search criteria and let Bubl\u2019s intelligent Discovery Mode find new tracks and artists to fall in love with.\nCreate different Discovery \u2018journeys\u2019 and discover a variety of new music. As time passes, Bubl will update your journeys with new tracks, ensuring there\u2019s always new music to enjoy.\n\nFor Artists\nBubl gives artists the opportunity to be heard on what is the world's first free music discovery platform.\u00a0\nReach new audiences and showcase up to five songs to a global audience whilst providing background information, lyrics and meaning to songs.\nDiscovery Mode is optional, ad-free, and Bubl will NEVER charge artists to be heard, nor charge listeners to enjoy new music in Discovery Mode.\u00a0\nNote: Listeners will only be able to listen to tracks once in Discovery mode, and no royalty payments are paid for plays in this feature.\u00a0\n\nStreaming\n\n\n\n\nFor listeners\nMusic lovers can listen to songs, watch music videos, create and share playlists with friends and groups, and enjoy other artist-exclusive content.\u00a0\nOn top of enjoying music for free in Discovery Mode, Bubl offers music made freely available by artists for a limited time or number of plays.\u00a0\nWe understand that not everyone wants, or is able to purchase a recurring subscription, which is why we have created Bubl\u2019s unique pay-per-play \u2018Jukebox\u2019 system. This allows music fans to purchase Bubl Credits from the app store and enjoy all premium content.\u00a0\nLast but not least, fans can now get even closer to the artists they love with Artist VIP Passes. Gain access to exclusive content as well as early access to new music, gig tickets, merchandise, live streams and more.\u00a0\n\nFor Artists\u00a0\nBubl gives artists and rights holders multiple ways of hosting music, as well as the opportunity to earn industry leading royalties. This flexibility gives less-established artists further opportunities to grow their audience easily and for free.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Discovery - The effortless way to reach new audiences. Artists can showcase up to 5 songs at a time.\u00a0Each song in Discovery can only be heard once per listener.\n\u00a0Free - Artists can choose not to monetise portions of their catalogue, allowing new listeners the chance to enjoy their music freely for a period of time or number of unique plays (streams).\n\u00a0Premium - Bubl Credit holders, Bubl subscribers* & VIP Pass Holders**\n\u00a0VIP Pass - Exclusive content available only to artist VIP Pass holders\n\nVIP Pass brings a new revenue opportunity and genuine ways to reward your most loyal fans. Give VIPs early access to music, merchandise and tickets, access to your exclusive content such as tracks, interviews, music videos, rehearsals, live streams, Q&As and more. YOU are the artist, YOU are in control. \u00a0\u00a0\n*Subscription launch TBC\n** Access to artist catalogue via VIP Pass dependent on rights holders permission.\u00a0\n\nSocial\n\n\n\nBuilt for the global music community, Bubl is designed to bring like-minded music lovers, artists, fans, labels, venues, music instructors and more together to discover and share new music, to support musicians, and to help better plan events.\nBubl makes the sharing and celebration of music safe and easy, while providing artists a meaningful way of growing and engaging with a global fanbase.\n\nRevenue Opportunities\nBubl provides new, unique revenue streams for artists and increased royalty payments for rights holders.\n\nJukeBox (Pay per play)\nRights holders will earn a penny per stream* via Jukebox mode. Founding artists will benefit from an existing 'economy' from day one, with Bubl Credits being awarded with listener and artist tiers.\n*UK penny (\u00a30.01) / US $0.014\u00a2 (at time of press)\n\nVIP Pass (\u00a33.99* / month per artist)\nFor the most loyal fans, VIP Passes grant access to all Exclusive content, and in many cases, access to the artist's entire catalogue. Artists will earn \u00a32.50 / VIP Pass holder per month, with \u00a30.44 going to Bubl, and the rest going to the taxman / payment provider.\u00a0Think of this a bit like Patreon, but alongside your music and social content.\n*US $5.49 / month per artist\n\nFor Labels / Rights Holders\nQuite simply, Bubl pays more per stream than other established platforms. Add unlimited free uploads for 12 months / life, meaningful social interactions with label followers, the support for physical sales in the future, and you've got a platform designed to fully support you and the artists you represent.\u00a0\nFor more information please visit our artist page.\n\nTimings & Release Plan*\nNov 30th 2021 - Kickstarter Campaign ends\nApril 2022 - Beta Live - access for those with a Backstage pass\nMay 2022 - Music content upload opens for day one Artists / Labels\nJune 2022 - Day One release to all day one Listeners / Artists and Labels\nJuly 2022 - Remaining backers (non-day one) invited in & Bubl available globally\u00a0\nAugust 2022+ - Further features added based on Bubl community feedback\n* FullTimings TBC & subject to change\n\nMinimum Viable Product (MVP)\nReaching the funding goal will enable the completion and release of Bubl's MVP, consisting of the following features:\n\nDiscovery Mode - Find and enjoy new music for free\nStreaming - Listen to artists, share music and playlists within Bubl\nSocial - Basic features (add friends, follow artists, post engagement)\n\n\nBeyond the MVP / Feature Voting\nBeyond this initial funding goal, we will commit to developing additional features post-launch including:\u00a0\n\nSubscriptions*\nMerchandising & Physical sales\nVideo live-streaming\nMusic venue integrations\nDeeper social functionality (event planning, creation of listening circles etc)\n\nEach of the above features is roughly the same in terms of integration / development, so Bubl can commit to building and supporting one of these for every \u00a3100,000 we raise beyond our campaign target.\u00a0\n\nExample - Kickstarter campaign raises \u00a3650,000, we commit to delivering the MVP in August 2022, and three further features, as chosen via a vote by the Bubl community.\u00a0\n\nThe order they will release in will be up to the global Bubl community, and how members choose to exercise their vote, which will take place in-app. (Bubl members must have Voting right in order to vote)\u00a0\n\nWhy are we doing this? Well, we are confident we are building a beautiful, easy to use app, but we are also conscious that the Bubl community will have their own ideas and needs - so we want to make sure that we are addressing those needs and supporting the very community we are building in every way possible.\n\n*Subscriptions will go live when Bubl has a set volume of content on the platform vs as a result of a vote.\n\nRewards\nBack Stage - Limited access to pre-release, Beta versions of Bubl. Help our developers ensure a stable, premium experience by providing feedback and reporting issues.\nJam Session - You're invited to a video meeting (or two) with the founder of Bubl. We will give you the chance to learn more about the platform, to share your thoughts and ask any questions you may have. Guitars optional.\u00a0\nGold Circle Ticket - Download and experience Bubl from day one as a listener. Make friends and discover new music before the rest of the world is let in.\nMain Stage Slot - As an artist, this gives you day one access and the chance to be one of the first to be heard on the Bubl*.\u00a0\nDay 1 Label Status - We're not just another DSP, and you're not going to want to miss the chance of being on Bubl from day one.*\u00a0\nGeneral Admission - Once all day one members have been granted access, those with General Admission permitted to log in and use Bubl.\nVIP Pass (1 Month) - A month's access to any artist's VIP content. For those purchasing tiers with multiple VIP Passes, you can choose to support one artist for several months, or several artists at once - the choice is yours.\nJukebox Plays - Bubl Credits allow you to listen to Premium content on the platform, without the need for a subscription. 1 Credit = One play. Like a digital Jukebox.\nDistribution Deal - For artists, labels and rights-holders, we are offering fee-free uploads for 12 months and for life. Quite simply, it won\u2019t cost you any money to upload your music tracks - whether that\u2019s an EP or a host of compilation albums.\nVoting @ Band Meeting - As described above (Beyond the MVP / Feature Voting) we will ask the Bubl community to make decisions around the design and development of the app. If you have a vote, you are invited to help decide how Bubl grows.\u00a0\nName(s) on the List - Bit like a nightclub, but without the scary bouncers. If you have this, you will have your name / artist name / label name in the credits. Forever. It\u2019s a small thing, but we want to ensure the world is aware that you helped bring Bubl to life.\nTicket for a Friend - What would a social platform be without your friends? With an extra invite you can introduce your friends to Bubl and get them discovering great new music in no time. All invited friends will have day one access, but NOT voting rights.\nExclusive Merchandise - Unique, digital items to adorn your listener, artist and label profiles. Show the world that you were one of the first on the platform. Badges and their designs will vary by tier. The designs are still TBD, but these launch badges will not be available once the Kickstarter campaign ends.\u00a0\nBubl Fanzine - Our music newsletter to keep up to date with all the goings on at Bubl with band features, development updates, offers and news.\n*Labels and Artists will be invited to upload content 1 month prior day one.\u00a0"

The Design is Made in Italy, the peculiarity also lies in the design that allows it to be used also as a wake skate or snow skate, moreover from this year Psykoboard has an added value: we have created the stick / handlebar, to transform it into a perfect scooter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can also be used when it rains and with puddles, as its peculiarity is that it is the first electric skateboard in the world with integrated splash guard, that is, you do not get wet when riding in the wet.\n It is a perfect SMART MOBILITY.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The electronic system and electric motors are completely waterproofed since the motor is housed inside the wheels, with a cooling system and self-regenerative braking, to recharge the Li-Poly battery.\n A comparison with the internal electric brushless wheel motors, and the brushless motors of other existing electric skateboards, Psykoboard's motors generate less heat, are protected from dust and water (waterproof level IP65), with better performance, efficiency and reliability, therefore safety. at the top.\n The two brushless wheel motors guarantee an acceleration of starting torque and formidable climbing performance (climbing grade 25%) and the drive wheel tires are replaceable.\n The lightweight battery can be quickly replaced without any problems.\n Psykoboard skateboard is controlled by a remote control with excellent ergonomic design of modest size, it has multiple functions, such as two speeds, including normal and sport. The remote control directs forward or reverse gear equally. Due to this peculiarity Psykoboard can be used to drive with front or rear wheel drive depending on the needs being a \"Twin Tip\".\n The Psykoboard skate comes with a replacement tire for the drive wheels, battery charger, battery, rechargeable remote control and key to adjust the trucks.\nLast year we had the honor of participating in a small appearance of the wonderful film \"La Vita davanti a s\u00e8\" by Eduardo Ponti with the great Sofia Loren who had an Oscar, golden globe and David di Donatello nomination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n PSYKOBOARD has all safety certifications such as: CE, FCC, RoHs, MSDS, UN, 38.3."

After our last 2 Kickstarters failed over a year ago we went away and grew our Instagram page\u00a0and continued to work on improving the machine.\nWe currently have a few generous people who have decided to spend over double the normal price on a machine just to help get us started. Thanks to their efforts we have already raised a total of \u00a335,000! We decided to do a kickstarter because there may be other people who want to join in on the initial funding and any more sales will help us reduce the cost to manufacture and increase our chances of success.\n\nIf you would like to pay extra for an early machine please\u00a0contact us first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGap in the market\nFor a long time Tormach and Taig have been the well know providers of small hobby cnc machines. We think its time for change.\nWhile these two companies aim to provide beginner friendly, high quality, hobby machines, and do a great job at it, we want to sell a low cost, mini vmc.\nAlso lots of people are wasting time and money on their 'DIY CNC' or 'CNC Conversion' and we want to stop that. It sounds exciting at first but halfway through you realise that its going to take much more time and money than you expect and the result won't be as good as you expect.\n\nWe want to make a machine so affordable and desirable, that there is no reason to attempt a DIY CNC anymore.\n\n\n\n\n\nVMC Prototype\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured on\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNC Conversion Kit\nIts basically a manual milling machine that you can convert to CNC by adding steppers and electronics. It can be shipped as a kit or mostly assembled so you can still get to experience the fun part of making your own machine. Assembling the machine yourself has the added benefit of teaching you how it works so if something needs to be replaced later, you will know exactly what to do.\nThe idea for the CNC Conversion kit actually came from a YouTube comment on our video. We think its a good place for us to start because there are few things to go wrong compared to making a complete vmc. It will also be the cheapest option and we want everyone to be able to experience this machines capability.\n\n\n\n\nNema 23 motor mounts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u00a0can this machine cut?\nThis machine will cut practically any material a large VMC will cut, its just a question of how fast.\nBelow shows a production run I did of 100 airsoft gun parts in 7075T6 aluminium.

Its earned its VMC title for that.\n\n\n\n\u00a0This machine can pay for itself!\nCNC machining has the potential to make you a lot of money. Whether you offer a service where you machine other peoples parts or you manufacture your own products at a fraction of the price, you could make a living with a machine like this.\u00a0\n\n\n\nXometry's partner program makes 16k in 7 days possible\n\n\n\n\nNow I'm not gonna pretend that you could pay for this machine in a day, or a week or even a few months, especially if you are new to this, but if you are willing to put in the work it will be possible.\nUnlike most DIY CNC's, you can be confident that the Samurai 120 will perform exceptionally, and will not suddenly stop working, which is crucial when using a machine to make money.\n\n\nServos\nWe know the struggles of using stepper motors so all our machines that include motors use JMC servos. They are tuned to optimise performance and improve crash safety.\nServos don't ever lose steps, and if they lose position (due to a crash) they send an alarm signal to the controller which e-stops the machine. They are also silent.\n\n\n\n100w JMC Servo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n180w Servo with brake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShielded way covers\nProtecting the motion components is one of the most important aspect of any metal cutting machine. Leaving ballscrews exposed to metal chips will very quickly destroy them and give you low quality parts.\nThe prototype machine has accordion way covers on the Y axis and they work ok but its a bit annoying having to clean them constantly. For me it is not acceptable to sell a product that has an inherently annoying aspect so we are using covers with stainless steel shields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMachine Software\nWe will be using Mach 4 on all our CNC machines because it is the best software that runs on Windows in our experience. Mach 4 gives us the option to write our own scripts and design custom UI without having to spend thousands developing our own software.\nNewfangled solutions also offer great support which is crucial to selling a CNC machine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMotion control\nWe spent years looking for a motion controller for this machine and couldn't find one that was good enough so we are developing our own with the help of PoLabs.\u00a0\n\nIt will be capable of 8 axis Step/Direction control. 5 Axis for machine, 2 for the ATC, and 1 spare for anything you want. Maybe a parts loader...\n20 outputs expandable up to 80\n30 inputs expandable to, well infinity really.\nUSB or Ethernet connectivity\nGalvanically isolated IO ports\nPendant support\nLCD Port\nPoBlocks graphical programming software\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrototype\nThis machine has been through hundreds of iterations over the years. I used this machine for a job shop business so any time there was something I didn't like, I would change it. I repeated that cycle for years and thats how we have ended up with an exceptional machine.\nApologies in advance for the poor quality images and messy workshop but when I was making this machine I had no intention of selling it so I didn't bother with fancy photos. I was also 18.\nI should also note I built this entire thing by hand and with a \u00a3100 drill press. All the machined components (excluding spindle) were made by a crappier version of this machine.\n\nDo Not try this at home... it was not fun.

This will be done separately to kickstarter.\nPlease\u00a0contact us\u00a0for more details.\nsamurai.machine.tools@gmail.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSamurai Machine tools merch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSamurai Machine Tools Emblem\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar example\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBT30 Spindle\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hardest part of making a DIY CNC is the spindle. The market is currently full of large spindles from China, so if you need a small BT30 spindle for your machine look no further.\n\n\nXYZ Axis\nDon't want to pay full price for a machine? Pledging for just 1 axis at a time might be the best option for you.\nThe idea is that you buy the Y axis (base) for example and only pay \u00a3800. You can then assemble it and assess the quality and if you are happy you can order the rest of the machine. This is great for people who understandably don't want to risk all their money on kickstarter.\u00a0\nAlternatively you could use it as a way to slowly upgrade your current DIY CNC. You could buy the spindle and attach it to your machine, then when you have saved up you could buy the Z axis (column) then base e.c.t.\n\n\n\nTable and base (X and Y axis)\n\n\n\n\n\nZ Axis (Column) Render*\n\n\n\n\n\nX & Y Axis (Base & Table)  Render*\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2Kw Spindle head\n\n\n\n\nSamurai 120 CNC Conversion Kit\nThis is the first version of the machine we will be making because it is the cheapest and there's fewer things to go wrong.\u00a0\nWhen you receive this machine you will have to assemble everything apart from the spindle. Then to get it working as a CNC machine you will need to add your own electronics. We will support you through this process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's included:\n\nXYZ Axis and spindle head\nSteel clad way covers\nPneumatic drawbar\nMachine protective sheet metal\nNema 23 motor mounts\nAir filter regulator\nBase mounting holes\nATC Upgrade ready\nPrecise homing sensors on all axis\n1Kw Servo motor and driver\nMGN12H & C Linear rails\n\u00a0SFU1604 & SFU2005 Ballscrews\u00a0\n\u00a02x Coolant hose\u00a0\nSpare grease and sealant\nSetup support\n\n\n\n\nSamurai 120 CNC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard CNC features:\n\nAutomatic precise homing on all axis and spindle\nAutomatic tool height probe\nAutomatic crash detection\nOverheat protection\nUSB or Ethernet PC connectivity for increased reliability\nATC capability (not included)\n5 Axis capability\nPoKeys 8 Axis CNC motion controller, with 80+ outputs and 100+ inputs\nMach 4 hobby licence\nE-stop, start, pause buttons included\nBT30 6000rpm\nPneumatic drawbar\nLinear rails on all axis\nC7 Ballscrews on all axis\nHigh performance grease lubrication\nFlood coolant capable\nRigid tapping\nSteel clad way covers\nFixture plate built into table\n280x190x220mm XYZ travel (11x7.5x8.6\")\n350mm (13.5\") Spindle nose to table\n\n\n\n\nSamurai 120 VMC\nThis is the full package. ATC, enclosure, flood coolant, touchscreen, lights, chip management, stand. Basically everything you would find in a typical VMC, just much smaller and much cheaper.\nWe are currently not making this version of the machine, but it will be available Q3 2022.\u00a0\nHowever if you pledge for a cnc or conversion kit you will later have the option to upgrade to the VMC.\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard VMC Features (coming later):\n\nWater-resistant enclosure\nChip management\nInfinite life chip filter\nFlood coolant\n14 Position ATC\nMachine stand\nTouchscreen\nBuilt in computer\nWIFI\nInternal monitoring camera\nRemotely control machine from anywhere in the world\nEmail / text alerts for crashes or other errors\n2 Lighting modes\nPower monitor\n\n\n\nAdd-ons\nATC - \u00a31500\nThe ATC is something we are currently developing and it is in the early prototype stage. When complete it should be capable of tool to tool in 6 seconds and hold 14 tools.\nYou will be able to attach it to any of our cnc machines.\n\nServos - \u00a3400\n2x 100w JMC integrated servos\n1x 180w JMC integrated servo with brake\n\nFirst part kit - \u00a3500\nIncludes everything needed to make a part, which is a tool tightening fixture.\n1x Precision Vice\n1x BT30 tool holder\n5x Vertex ER Collets\n5x High quality end mills appropriate for the job\n5x Aluminium billets\n1x Small air compressor\nSupport through the process and instruction videos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight to repair\nWe think customers should have the right to repair any product they own. Also with a CNC machine it is much easier to find faults and fix them with new parts unlike a smartphone or any other device.\nThis machine has been designed to make assembly and disassembly relatively easy, but more importantly, the most expensive component on this machine costs just \u00a3200. That means if there is ever an issue with anything, its likely that you will only be set back \u00a3200 at most, and thats something completely new to the industry.\nAlso the total cost of all the bearings is \u00a3200, that means in a few years when the machine is near the end of its life you can replace all bearing components for \u00a3200 and the machine will be as good as new.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike most companies, we charge less money for replacement parts than they cost us. That way if you need to buy a replacement part, we lose money, and therefore there is no conflict of interest. Many other companies charge way too much on replacement parts, essentially making money from that, therefore they have no interest to make a more reliable product since they make money when something goes wrong.\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u00a0is required for us to make the machines?\nWe are past the prototyping stage, and the final CAD models are mostly completed, but there is still some work to do to ensure the models are perfect. The next thing to do is order the components from china, give the go ahead to our UK manufacturers, and make some of the aluminium parts ourselves. The only thing we haven't decided on yet is the material for the sheet metal. Its likely to be 5051 but we are considering SS304 or Aluminized steel for increased durability.\n\n\n\nMild steel base that will be CNC Machined\n\n\nA production prototype will be made and tested to ensure all the improvements from the prototype don't have any negative effects and if all is good the rest of the machines will be made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFailure\nWe all know Kickstarter is notorious for having failed projects and we don't want to follow that trend. With the initial batch, we can actually guarantee your machine will be made, and if not, you will get a full refund.\nFor the Kickstarter machines to be made, we will need to make a total of 40 sales by September 2022. Previously it would have been difficult for us to guarantee that but we are very quickly growing our Instagram page and are finding new potential buyers every week. Also when the Initial batch machines are delivered that will convince a lot more people to buy.\n\n\nPayment\nKickstarter payments are done through bank transactions and there is not the option for PayPal. You will only be charged at the end of the campaign so please make sure your card has sufficient funds by that time (1st December).\n\nPayment for the initial batch will be done via PayPal invoice and there will be the option for financing.\u00a0\n\n\nShipping\nWhile we do offer worldwide shipping, there is currently a huge supply chain issue in the global economy and that will slow things down. As a result, we are not including the shipping price in the pledge amount so you will have to pay for that after the campaign. The price may range from \u00a3400-1000 and lead time is not guaranteed right now. If you need a machine urgently you may be able to pay extra for faster delivery.\nWhat we can guarantee however is that the machines will be made in just a few months so if the situation does improve you may receive a machine much sooner than you expect.\n\nWarranty\nYou will get one year warranty on your Samurai for parts that unexpectedly fail. However it is expected that ballscrews and other bearings will wear down according to how you use the machine.\nAll parts to the machine will be available on our website and installation instructions will also be available."

Two decades later, we are inching our way closer to federal legalization, with more than a third of U.S. states legalizing both medicinal and recreational adult use. What does that mean? An influx of cannabis information, products, strains and terminology have made their way into everyday conversation and consumption.\nWhen I moved to Colorado, I experienced this firsthand; I was completely overwhelmed by the amount of products available. I thought, how can one keep track of every product they consume? How can you remember to not purchase a strain that once made you feel paranoid? I wanted a quick and easy tool to keep track of what I like, and with the incorporation of a rating system, weed out what I don\u2019t.\nMy partner Travis's late father attempted to learn more about medical marijuana but found it uncomfortable to walk into a modern dispensary with no cannabis knowledge. He was overwhelmed by all of the products. The information given to him by budtenders did not match his personal experience with cannabis strains and products, and he began journaling his cannabis journey to discover his preferences himself.\nTogether, Travis and I felt Chronicle was a product that could benefit all types of cannabis consumers \u2014 even the experienced cannabis user. We've been running the cannabis design agency Resin Refinery together for three years, with the goal of reducing the stigma surrounding cannabis brands. We have helped dispensaries and brands appeal to the modern cannabis consumer and now feel that we can make a larger impact directly helping cannabis consumers. Our design and development skills allowed us to create Chronicle with no starting capital.\nAt this point, 75% of the base functionality is in the Chronicle app, with just minor backend work remaining. We have our app flow finished and now just need to clean up the design and experience.\nOur budget will primarily be used for marketing purposes. Because cannabis isn't federally legal, social media platforms have yet to update their content policies to reflect legalization in large portions of the country \u2014 making it difficult for cannabis-related companies to effectively market their products. Therefore our efforts will be accomplished by partnering with the right influencers and promoting posts.\n\n\nEarly Bird Supporter:\n\n\n\nFor our limited Early Bird Supporters- You will receive our Limited Edition Orange Chronicle Hat, A personal thank you from the founders, Access to our Discord group + our Chronicle Sticker Pack\n\n\nEarly Bird Super Fan:\n\n\n\nFor our limited Early Bird Super Fans - You will receive a personal Thank You Note from our founders, BETA Access to Chronicle(Prior to official launch), Access to our Private Discord Group, Chronicle Swag Backpack, Black Beanie, Limited Edition Orange/Grey Hat, Black Chronicle Ceramic Campfire Coffee Mug, Orange Chronicle Coffee Mug, Limited Edition Orange Chronicle Hoodie\n\n\n\nTier 1 Rewards:\n\n\n\nTier 1 Rewards will receive early access to Chronicle prior to our official launch as well as their name in the credits of the app\n\n\nTier 2 Rewards:\n\n\n\nTier 2 Rewards will have their profile added to our community page, receive a Chronicle sticker + Tier 1 Rewards\n\n\nTier 3 Rewards:\n\n\n\nTier 3 Rewards will receive a Chronicle Fanny Pack and a Founding Member Badge + Tier 1 & 2 Rewards\n\n\nTier 4 Rewards:\n\n\n\nTier 4 Rewards will receive an embroidered Chronicle hat, a personal thank you from the founders, access to our private Discord group, a Chronicle sticker pack, + Tiers 1-3 Rewards\n\n\nTier 5 Rewards:\n\n\n\nTier 5 Rewards will receive a Black/Orange Chronicle Hoodie, Black/Orange Chronicle Hat, Black Chronicle Ceramic Campfire Coffee Mug  + Tiers 1-4 Rewards [MASON JAR SET NOT INCLUDED PER KICKSTARTER POLICY]]\n\n\nTier 6 Rewards:\n\n\n\nTier 6 Rewards will receive a Limited Edition Orange Chronicle Shirt, Black/Orange Beanie, Exclusive Wall Art by one of Founders, Orange Chronicle Coffee Mug, Exclusive Chronicle Branded Duffle Bag  + Tiers 1-5 Rewards\n\n\n"

This is SUNLU official group. As a good supporter of the 3D printing industry, SUNLU strongly recommends all 3D fans join our New FilaDryer S2 crowdfunding because we try our best to bring high-quality machines to everyone as the vision of SUNLU\u201cTechnology Enabling Creation Easier.\u201d\n\nSUNLU appreciates all people who accompany us growing up on the 3D road together. As the development in the 3D industry, SUNLU has more than 30 warehouses across the countries. We try to reach every 3D lover from the whole world by setting up the website: www. sunlu.com.\u00a0\n\nAlso, we expand social media into Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, Twitter, Tiktok, Reddit, and Snapchat as well. You can find us by searching @SUNLUOFFICIAL. Please join SUNLU's big family!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo prevent moisture, each 3D printing filament is dried and vacuumed before shipping. Because of the printing effect, the dampened filaments are unsatisfactory. However, we cannot predict if the filaments can be finished at once, so the rest of the filaments will be dampened. When using the remaining filaments again, it feels like you are having bread that has been exposed in the air all night long. You can have it, but the taste is terrible.\n\n\n\n\n\n1) \u00a0\u00a0360 \u00b0 constant temperature\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause of the printing effect, the dampened filaments are unsatisfactory. Therefore, as we expected, SUNLU created New Filament Dryer S2. \u00a0Compare to the first generation, S2 has a round inner box that has 360 \u00b0 constant temperature and uniform heating\n\n2) All-around Double Heating Plates Increase the Temperature Up to 70 Degrees\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoreover, the design of upper and lower double heating plates increased 30% heating efficiency, so the heating temperature was from a standard 50\u00b0 C to 70\u00b0C which is 20\u00b0 C higher than similar products on the market. Because the heating speed is more complete and fast, the limitation does not restrict the filament surface. Also, S2 can accept more kinds of filaments and is not limited to several common types. Also, S2 not only can shorten the length of drying consumables into two hours but also dry high-end filaments such as PA/PC.\n\n3) \u00a0Touch-screen\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.42*2.87inch smart touch screen within 0.1-second touch feedback. It can be accurately set even under poor lighting conditions. You can set up the temperature, duration, consumable type, and lighting as well.\n\n4) \u00a0Automatically Setting Temperature and Times\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the test, the best drying time and temperature are summarized, like PLA, TPU, and PETG, etc. Which reduced the workload of searching consumables setting dates. Cutimazize temperature and times at the touch of a button through the touchscreen.\n\n5) \u00a0Anti-skid-properties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreasing the bottom-supported by adding four feet in the bottom can improve the function of anti-skid.\n\n6)\u00a0Avoid the Heating Conduction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe four feet in the bottom does not only improve the functionality of anti-skid but also avoids the heat conduction to other objects by adding more space between product and surface.\n\nS2 has even more accomplishments. I'm keeping it a secret as long as crowdfunding develops. We are very welcome your perspective, suggestions, and comments. Also, your advice motivates us to improve!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0SUNLU has its own proprietary intellectual property patent formula and its own professionally developed production line. It has a wide range of applications. The product has successfully passed RoHS and other test certifications.

Ta-Da Chair Series 2 is the ideal essential for those who seek portability and functionality.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen stashed, It serves as a hiking stick with a comfortable grip; and to make it a chair, it takes only a second to set up. Let us show you how fast and easy it is to set it up!\n\n\n\n\n\nTa-Da Chair Series 2 is perfect for all kinds of outdoor activities: camping, hiking, beach trips, picnics, festivals and concerts - you name it!\nIt folds slim into a hiking stick that boasts extra mobility and won\u2019t occupy any precious space in your backpack when you\u2019re out there venturing. Grab a chair and enjoy the moment. Wherever, whenever!\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Features\n\n\u00a0Instant Set Up: Easy unfold & take down in 1 second\n\u00a0Lightweight Durability: Aviation-grade aluminum alloy material weighs less than 1kg (2.1 lbs)\n\u00a0Robust Structure: Steady & high weight capacity that holds up to 130kg (286.6 lbs)\n\u00a0Ergonomic Seating Height: 50cm (19.6\") above the ground, effortless sit down & quick get up\n\u00a0Solid Seat: Firm seating without sinking in\n\u00a0Versatile Use: Double as a hiking stick that takes no extra space in your backpack\n\u00a0Easy Storage & Carry: Every chair comes with a FREE storage bag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA simple design is not equal to compromising on the details. In order to be comfortable from sitting down to getting up, the seating height is 50cm off the ground, while most camping chairs and stools sit low, so no need to overly bend your knees and scrunch your legs to get up!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen sitting down, your legs are in a natural position with sufficient space to keep yourself comfortable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost foldable camping chairs come with fabric seats that allow you to sink into it, it is difficult to get out of and could be uncomfortable for your legs and knees, or it gets saggy after some time of use. When you sit down, The solid texture seat provides a firm seating; and it is also a breeze to get up when you need to act fast on the move.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith its special design, setting up is easier than ever, just like opening and closing an umbrella. Simply release the seat lock, push the switch grip down and secure it. It takes only a second, and you\u2019ve got yourself a comfy seat!\n\n\n\n\n\nTo take down and stow it, pull the seat up and lock it back into a slim stick.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTa-Da Chair Series 2 is a compact yet heavy duty chair. The aviation-grade aluminum alloy structure allows the chair to hold its position and prevents it from collapsing easily. Combining the reinforced stainless steel rim and the safety buckle, it weighs only 1 kg (2 lbs) yet supports weight up to 130kg (286 lbs). The anti-slip and anti-sink rubber feet with a spiral pattern that provides more stability, allowing the chair to be placed anywhere from pebble path to smooth surface.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe seat and the plastic components are UV resistant, and the frame is made of top quality aviation-grade aluminum alloy, making it not only strong, but also corrosion resistant, waterproof and easy to clean. No matter the weather condition or the terrain, this is the perfect essential for all your outdoor activities!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAiming to provide great portability and extra mobility, it is light in weight and comes with an ergonomic handle that is made easy for taking it on the go and serves as a hiking stick, taking no space in your backpack or luggage.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith every Ta-Da Chair Series 2, we offer a free storage bag. The bag is made of nylon and it is laundry machine washable and strong. You can toss it in the back of the trunk or carry it another way using the strap to bring it over the shoulders.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColor and size options will be confirmed via the Kickstarter survey after the campaign ends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are lots of foldable chairs on the market, but we noticed that many of them or the camping gears require taking more time and several steps to put together. If less time is spent on set up, the more time is saved for enjoying.\nAnother seemingly inevitable issue with most foldable chairs is that no matter what kind of chair you bring along to the outdoors, even the lightest ones take up space in your backpack, it's still the burden for space-conscious people, so we wondered if we could give the chair another purpose when it\u2019s folded. Therefore, we came up with the idea of combining these functions and Ta-Da Chair was born.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe made operating the chair super fast and easy, just like opening and closing an umbrella - absolutely effortless, perfect for users of all ages. However, it\u2019s not easy to make a simple and one-piece design that is as steady and durable. From the structure to the material, we spared no detail and worked hard to overcome the challenges. After months of tests and adjustments, we managed to create the folding chair that met our standards, and we sincerely hope you will find it amazing, too!\nAbout Ta-Da Chair Series 2\nWe call this project Ta-Da Chair \"Series 2\" as this is the upgraded version of our previous design. In hope of bringing convenience and comfort, but without sacrificing on the experience, we have created the 1st generation of Ta-Da Chair earlier. We valued the feedback from every user and we knew that this product had the potential to be even better.\nHere are some major upgrades and improvements that we made for Ta-Da Chair Series 2:\n\nReinforced stainless steel rim\n\nThe structure of Series 2 is simpler but it provides more sturdiness and durability than the 1st generation. After the hard work on research and tests, we designed a reinforced stainless steel rim to hold the structure better and provide more stability. With this new design,\u00a0the weight capacity has been increased: Series 2 can support up to 130kg, which is 30kg more than the 1st generation (around 100kg capacity load).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeat surface enlargement\n\nThe area of the seat surface of Series 2 is larger and wider by 15% than the 1st generation for extra comfort.\n\nPush-to-open switch grip\n\nIn the 1st generation, the lock has to be twisted to unlock and expand the chair. For Series 2, we made a refinement of the lock and changed the way from twisting to clipping, and the new switch grip is made for easy operation: push it to unfold, and pull it to pack up - saving you force and time, with much smoother movement.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClosed loop handle\n\nThe handle of Series 2 is shaped into a closed loop for a comfortable grip, and you can also hang it for easy storage.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter one year of numerous brainstorming, refinements and tests, we\u2019re proud to present Ta-Da Chair Series 2 with the enhanced features that allow you to venture out with ease and flexibility, and we\u2019re sure that you\u2019ll be satisfied with it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere in Step2Gold, we have accumulated years of solid experience and techniques, all products are made with precision down to every detail; and with our own factory in our homeland, every process during the manufacturing is carefully planned and monitored to hold the best control of production and quality. It is our goal to develop innovative and top quality products to improve outdoor experience and make everyday life more convenient and joyful.\nWe\u2019re proud to be recognized by several international design awards: Good Design, International Design Excellence Awards, Concours L\u00e9pine International Paris, Geneva International Inventions etc. \u00a0\n\u00a0Press Kit\uff5cYouTube\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 2,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $900M raised between them. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project is boosted by BackerCrew.\n\n\n"

The guideline is to wash for 20 seconds.\nWell, humans are very bad at estimating time and what they think is 20 seconds, is really about 5 seconds!\nIn addition, while they scrub their hands with soap, the water is usually running, which is very wasteful. Now, I'm a person who cares deeply about saving water and even have a product that helps reduce water waste! You can check it out at \u00a0https://SensiTap.com and watch the brief video on the home page.\nLastly, I watch children do a half-hearted job of scrubbing, given their short attention spans.\nI decided that I would make a product that would help solve all three problems:\n\nEnsure that hands were scrubbed for the required amount of time\nSave water while doing so\nEntertain children while they washed\n\nWe plan to make the device transparent, so folks can see how HandyDandy works!

        "Text": "The Idea\nCreate warm winter memories by bringing your wood and gas stove to life with the Humid-i-Fire fountain and humidifier. It will delight family members and friends, and add a spark to holiday gatherings.\n\nThe Humid-i-Fire is a high-tech fountain and humidifier that you use on wood or gas stoves. It can even operate on your gas kitchen stove. It humidifies the air while adding a tranquil and decorative touch to any stove and requires no power cord or batteries.\nSeveral prototypes have been tested, and now it\u2019s time to bring this amazing idea to your home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA thermoelectric generator in the base of the fountain produces all the electricity the Humid-i-Fire needs to run efficiently and quietly. When the fountain base contacts the hot stovetop, it generates electricity that powers the fountain\u2019s pump.\nThe patented Humid-i-Fire is functional and practical. Yet the sight and sound of the fountain bubbling away on your stove also adds a lovely ambiance to the room, whether you are reading a book, playing games with family or friends, or just relaxing on a cold winter night.\n\n\n\nThe Humid-i-Fire humidifies the dry winter air\n\n\n\nWhile we can't do much about the snow or cold weather, gathering with family and friends around the wood stove is a great way to create warm winter memories. My friends helped inspire me to build the Humid-i-Fire, and with the encouragement and support of the Kickstarter community, you can enjoy a Humid-i-Fire in your home too.\n\nWe Can\u2019t Do This Without You\nAfter two years of developing the Humid-i-Fire, we are ready to bring it to market. Funding the rollout and initial production run is a costly undertaking. To get the Humid-i-Fire into production and into your and other customers\u2019 homes, we'll need to invest a lot of money in the production plan and buy all the components. By pre-ordering your Humid-i-Fire, you are helping pay the upfront production costs.\nWith generous people like you and Kickstarter on our side, we have the chance to make the dream of the inventor come true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe believe in the Kickstarter community of people who support each other.\nEach dollar pledged will help bring this innovative, appealing stovetop fountain and humidifier to life!\nWith your generous support, we plan to ship the Humid-i-Fire in September 2022.\n\nPrototypes\n\n\n\nrectangular prototype\n\n\n\n\n\nround and rectangular prototypes\n\n\nNote: All humid-i-Fires used in the videos and pictures are prototypes. The shape , size and design of the final product might change.\nThe Thermoelectric Generator\nThe Humid-i-Fire\u00a0uses a thermoelectric generator, which is a device that converts heat directly into electrical energy. German physicist Thomas Johann Seebeck invented the thermoelectric generator in 1821. Recent advances have improved their energy efficiency and lowered their cost, so they are now common in many industries. For example, they generate electricity for remote pipelines, communication towers, and even the Mars Rover Curiosity has one!\n\n\n\nThermoelectric generator\n\n\nWhat\u2019s Included\nFor this Kickstarter campaign we are launching the Humid-i-Fire, which includes a metal bowl, slate tile, polished stones, a water pump and a generator, all shown in the video and pictures above. The fountain holds one gallon of water, for approximately 8 hours of operation, depending on stove temperature and humidity levels.\u00a0\nUnlike any other humidifier on the market today, all that\u2019s needed to operate the Humid-i-Fire is water and a hot stove (wood or gas!). Dependable, eco-friendly, and unique\u2014the Humid-i-Fire will bring you many years of enjoyment!\nNote: All humid-i-Fires used in the videos and pictures are prototypes. The shape , size and design of the final product might change.\n\n\n\n\nFinal production schedule (2021/2022)\n\n\n\n\nA word about Ken Adler, the inventor of the Humid-i-Fire\nThe inventor, Kenneth, has worked on projects to protect wetlands, minimize pesticide runoff into rivers, and reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from old diesel trucks. He has used the same knowledge, experience, and passion for creating the eco-friendly patented Humid-i-Fire for you.\nHe had the idea and skills, and he brought brainstorming, tinkering, and testing. This is his first patented product, and he couldn't be prouder of it.\n\n\n\nKen Adler, inventor of the Humid-i-Fire\n\n\nTHANK YOU for your Consideration\nAt Wintercocoon, we are very excited about this project and it\u2019s potential and we hope you share the same energy and passion to make it happen!\u00a0\nDon't forget to spread the word about the Humid-i-Fire by telling your family and friends about my campaign.\nWe look forward to watching our Kickstarter community grow!\nTogether with Kennet, we sincerely thank you for your consideration of our project."

You need to back them up, quickly and error-free.\n\n...But then problems start popping up. Have you already backed up this particular card or not?? One card gets backed up twice but the others never get copied\u2026 Individual files and time-lapse sequences get mixed up or corrupted\u2026 Same-name files overwrite the older ones you still needed... Drives disconnect; copy never resumes... Stress. Stress. Stress!\n\nPlease. Stop doing it manually.\u00a0\n\n...Yes, but the dedicated backup devices are rather expensive! - you might say.\nYup. And rather limited in features, too - by design.\u00a0\nBut Copy.Cab has no issues like these.\n\nCopy.Cab intelligently inspects your files and automatically processes them - the way you want it.\nDelegate all the tedious stuff to Copy.Cab, and keep your data safe and sound - without the $500 expense!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy.Cab checks for all kinds of gotchas before they even happen. Not enough space? Duplicate files? External drive disconnected during offload? Copy.Cab alerts you to all that and offers one-click solutions.\n\nCopy.Cab actually can work as a dedicated backup device, too (without the high price tag) - just install it on your mobile or a \"stick\" PC. Turn it on; Copy.Cab starts automatically, ready to back up your cards. Awesome!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow is Copy.Cab different from just copying your data manually?\n\nCopy.Cab:\n- Automates operations, remembers the last drives and folders you worked with\n- Perfectly copies your card, drive, or a single folder by checking on possible errors BEFORE they happen!\n- Pre-flights your backup with visual snapshot, alerts you beforehand with exact issues, offers good solutions. Just press the button - the worry is ours, the choice is yours.\n\n- Fast! As fast as your OS!\n\n- Backs up any digital files: photos, videos, documents, anything.\n- Backs up (offloads) any card or drive.\n- Synchronizes any folder to any other folder.\n- Makes an Exact copy, OR Incremental copy - whichever you like.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- A full copy of your card/drive structure, with all its files and folder tree, is a default. But you can also choose what files to include in (or exclude from) the backup. (see LEVELS)\nYou see, sometimes you need the perfect mirror of your directories and files, including service/sidecar files\u2026 while another time you don\u2019t!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Copy.cab can intelligently process your files. Missing time/date stamps? Missing Geolocation? (see LEVELS) Files with the same names but different content that would normally just overwrite your older ones, leading to lost data? No worries. Copy.Cab can handle and fix all that!\n- Detects and organizes time-lapse image sequences automatically (see LEVELS)\n- Remembers what went where, and can instantly remind you\n\n- Shows you Previews of your content, plus lists your file data, for better assurance that you are, in fact, working with the right files\n- Uniquely renames files to prevent name clashes, or leaves everything untouched - your choice, just click on settings\n\n- Very stable.

If our business disappears, your Copy.Cab continues working. You are safe.\n\n- Based on decades of digital file wrangling experience by our developers. \u00a0Just like you, we know what needs to be done, and here we give you the complete solution based on our vast experience.\u00a0\n- Use Copy.Cab in the field, professional environment, or home.\n\nWhy is it called Copy.Cab?\nCab stands for both file cabinet in Windows, and for a fast vehicle that professionally transports you from one point to another. Seems like a fit for this software!\nOh, and we were lucky to get a domain name Copy.Cab as well, for our upcoming website! (see LEVELS)\n\nIs Copy.Cab suitable for home use?\u00a0\nSay, if I wanted to back up my camera memory cards with vacation photos and videos??\nYes!\n\nIs Copy.Cab suitable for professional use?\u00a0\nFor example, by a data wrangler on a photo or film set?\nYes!\n\nCan Copy.Cab be installed on a tablet, desktop, notebook, Windows phone?\nYes, yes, and yes!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the requirements?\n- Windows 7/8/10/11 (or a virtual environment if you are on iOS or other operating systems)\n\nThink of Copy.Cab as your perfectly attentive, fast assistant that never makes a mistake in handling your files. It will:\n- Show you the contents of the card visually so you'd instantly know whether this is the intended one or not\n- Allow you to choose Full backup (a new copy of all the contents) or Incremental backup (just the difference from the last time you copied your data from this source.)\n- Check whether there's enough space on the destination drive to complete the operation.\n- Detect whether there are any file name clashes and offer to apply an automatic fix. So you won't lose your older data by simply writing it over if it's actually different!\n- Detect if there are any time-lapse sequences and offer to put them into a separate folder; as well as make a draft video preview for you. What a time saver!\n- Alert you if either the source or destination drives disconnected during the transfer\n- Actually continue writing long files from where it left off (after the transfer resume or on drive re-connect) - instead of just starting anew! A huge time saver.\n- Use multi-threading to complete the job ASAP for you\n- Verify the backup\n...and more!\n\nThere are so many things you'd have to manually do, each being an opportunity for human error to creep in, and some taking an extremely long time. \u00a0Why do it the hard way?\nCopy.Cab just does it all for you natively, quickly, and error-free every time!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUNLOCK the Levels!\n- $1,300: you get your Copy.Cab v1.1 download\n- $1,900: the website is designed and maintained with the Versioning, Support, and Download zones\n- $2,400: a feature to fix the missing Geolocation and Time-Date stamp is added\n- $2,900: a feature to include/exclude certain file types from the backup\n- $3,500: the automatic time-lapse processing feature is added!\n- $4,700: a certified Installation package is obtained\n\n\nPlease support this project and get your Copy.Cab soon - or give it as a gift to someone you know may need it!\nThank you very much."

You can incorporate shifting gears from major manufacturers such as Shimano, SRAM, and Campagnolo with virtual shifting. By selecting the exact number of sprockets and gear ratios, you can maximize your training effect.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0What is the popular Virtual Cycling App?\nThe Virtual Cycling App is a cutting-edge home training program that allows you to enjoy cycling indoors. You can experience the virtual cycling world as if you were riding there yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipants from all over the world can train and compete in the virtual world. Participants from around the world train, compete and ride in friendly competitions with their friends. Recently, the world's premier road bike race, the Tour de France, was held in a virtual space and generated a great deal of excitement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTour de France // First Steps - Watopia Hillery Rivers YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomatically applies a constant load determined by the algorithm according to the difficulty of the workout set by the player. The cadence sensor and torque sensor allow for accurate FTP measurement.\n\nFTP mode is a program used by professional athletes for high-intensity training.\nThe FTP training mode allows you to train quickly and efficiently according to the level you choose. You can also measure your own FTP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIT CYCLE is compatible with a variety of virtual apps, allowing you to play apps right away without the need for complicated settings. Virtual apps can be broadly divided into two types: those that ride on real, live-action scenery and those that ride on 3DCG scenery.\n\nThe appeal of virtual cycling lies in its realism. The system automatically changes the load by interfacing sensors with the app, and the load reflects the slope of the hill, air resistance, and other details of the surrounding environment, making it very close to the actual ride.\n\nYou can ride on real roads around the world in the comfort of your own home with your smart bike, and the high-resolution 4K live-action scenery will make you feel as if you are really there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApps that support live-action scenery\n\nKinomap\nKinomap is an app that allows you to ride real courses taken by cyclists around the world. The number of courses is over 100,000! Of course, there are also Japanese courses taken by Japanese cyclists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nROUVY\nThis is an app that allows you to ride with live-action scenery from around the world + your own 3DCG avatar. It also supports parameters such as automatic load, cadence, and heart rate, making it the perfect app for training.\n\n\n\n\n\nFULGAZ\nThis is an app that allows you to run in real-life scenery that supports the highest 4K quality. The picture quality is so beautiful that you can experience the seaside of Los Angeles or the Hawaiian Islands as if you were there. It also supports various sensors, making it ideal for training.\nApps that support 3DCG scenery\n\n\n\n\n\nONELAP\nYou and your friends can run together in a 3DCG world. There are many game elements such as various missions and avatar customization, so you can gamify your training to avoid boredom!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZwift\nZwift is said to be the best virtual bike app. It has a whopping 3 million members worldwide and 100,000 players in Japan! Zwift was also used by Corona to stage the Tour de France. Not only can you train with professional riders, but you can also customize your avatar, road bike, and more.\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison List of Various Applications\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI want to try it!\n\u00a0But... the hurdle to play is too high.\nCurrently, there are two major combinations of equipment needed to play with Zwift.\nIn this case, the cost of the smart trainer alone is $900 to $1,800USD, and you also need to prepare a road bike to attach to the trainer.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the second case, the cost is lower than in the first, but you need more equipment and more time to set up. In addition, both of them require a road bike as a prerequisite, making it difficult to get started.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll you need is your smartphone and FIT CYCLE\nIn the midst of all this, a spin bike-type trainer called \"Smart Bike\" has appeared overseas this year.\u00a0\n\nSmart bikes, which can be optimized to your own position without the need to set up a bike, have been attracting attention, but they are very expensive, costing around $4,500USD, and are only for professional use.\n\nBecause of this, we have set an affordable price so that everyone can enjoy Virtual Cycling at their homes. We have developed Japan's first integrated fitness machine with various built-in sensors.\nFurthermore, it is possible to experience virtual cycling indoors at a low cost!\nVirtual training for everyone! As people spend more and more time at home, why don't you enjoy exercising with FIT CYCLE?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a record of the weight loss of a customer at a gym that installed this product. This is the result of comprehensive guidance by the trainer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirtual training lifestyle with FIT CYCLE.\nAs explained earlier, the sensors and control CPU necessary for virtual training are integrated, so you can start immediately as long as you have a device such as a smartphone and the main unit.\n\nVirtual training apps such as Rouvy and Bkool, provide the experience of riding in the real world. Kinomap, lets you ride through videos taken and posted by other cyclists, and TrainerRoad, which specializes in upping your game. Choose the app that best fits your goals and motivation, and enjoy cutting-edge training!\n\nROUVY offers a real-world riding experience\nMulti-functional sensors are compatible with virtual training apps.\n\n\n\n\n\nFIT CYCLE is equipped with the following advanced sensors and CPU. This allows you to take full advantage of the app's features for an enhanced virtual ride.\nAutomatic load function (power meter) that realistically reproduces gradients on hills and other slopes\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomatically adjusts the load on the virtual ride to match the course. The trainer automatically adjusts the load according to the course on the virtual ride. When the course on the app goes up a hill, the load on the trainer automatically changes to match the slope of the hill, giving you a realistic ride.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0The load is applied by changing the voltage on the electromagnetic magnet. This happens by moving the electromagnet closer or further away from the flywheel.\u00a0\nSince it is a non-contact system, the unit is very quiet.\nIt can apply a stronger load than ordinary magnet load systems and allows a wide range of load adjustments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquipped with a sensor that measures the cadence (number of revolutions of the crank per minute) of the bicycle.\nWhen you ride, be aware of keeping the cadence constant and choose a gear that does not strain your legs, which will reduce the burden and make your cycling more comfortable.\nFinding the right cadence for you is an important point when riding, and depends on the individual's physical strength and build, the type of bicycle, length of the crank, situation, and more.\n\n\n\n\n\nManage your exercise record with smartwatch and healthcare integration\nAlthough the heart rate sensor on the handlebars can be used, using a smartwatch will allow you more freedom, accuracy, and integration with your health care system (*specifications may vary depending on the app). Keep track of your exercise records along with a variety of other biometric data to keep track of your overall health status in life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe designed FIT CYCLE to become a fitness partner in your daily life. \u00a0\"no noise\" is a point that cannot be overlooked.\nThe FIT CYCLE is so quiet that it can be compared to a whisper or a late night in the suburbs. This means you don't have to worry about disturbing your neighbors.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoyable on a variety of devices\nAs explained in the beginning, you will need a device such as a smartphone to run the virtual training app.\nDepending on the situation, you can choose the best way to use the device according to the size of the room and the device you have, such as using a computer, projecting on a TV screen, or using a projector. Can be used as a standalone machine.\n\nEven if you don't use the virtual cycling app, you can use the FIT CYCLE app to set the load that suits you best and checks your calorie consumption.\nYou can also update the machine\u2019s software through the app.\nThe FIT CYCLE app will be available for download from the App Store and Google Play Store.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that the design is in the development stage and is subject to change.\n\nFine adjustment of the saddle and handlebars\nThe saddle can be adjusted from 81cm to 98cm, and the handlebars from 97cm to 108cm. (The saddle can also be moved forward and backward by 0-5.5 cm)\nThe height range is 145-190cm, so it can be adjusted to fit various body sizes for comfortable use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe legs in front of the main unit are equipped with wheels for easy movement. This makes it easy for a single person to move it around, such as when redecorating or rearranging the room.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no need for complicated setups required in conventional virtual training.

Like most people when they become a pet parent, for the first time, he had almost no idea what to do. In order to find answers to his questions he surfed the internet and asked around (mostly veterinarians). But he realized that he had to visit multiple websites to find simple solutions and he couldn't ask a vet all the time. That's when the idea was born.\n\u00a0\nWhat if there was an application that would have all of these answers and more, in one place?\u00a0\nAnd that was the turning point. \u00a0The answer to these questions and doubts summarized through our application.\u00a0\n\nTHE APPLICATION \ud83d\udcf1\nAt this point, in the state that the whole project is in, we need your assistance in order for it to be implemented in perfection.\nBelow, there are some features that the app contains :\n\n\nDetailed information about 350+ dog breeds\nInformation about what foods they can or can't eat and recipes\nScheduling (for vet visits or daily reminders for eating, playing, walking etc)\nFinding places of interest nearby like vets, pet shops, pharmacies, parks, dog hotels and grooming services\n\nNetworking:\n\nFind friends nearby\nChat with friends\nCreate posts for dogs that were lost, found, or are up for adoption\nCreate a profile for each of your dogs and see how much they should eat daily, upload photos to keep as an archive\nCreate a QR code with your information to print and put on your dog's collar in case they ever get lost\n\nFuture stuff (with your assistance):\n\nBecome a dog walker or find dog walkers near you\nCreate an electronic medical booklet to keep track of vaccines and treatments for each of your dogs.\nKeep track of how many steps you walk with your furry friends\nDetailed ways of how to train your dog and play with it (with videos)\nVirtual assistant that will answer your questions\nVideo recipes\nFind the breed using image recognition\nCurrent laws, concerning pets, per country\n\n\nYOUR ASSISTANCE \ud83e\udd1d\nAs mentioned above, your assistance will help the app expand beyond its current state.

        "Text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause human behavior is so unpredictable, clever, creative and incredibly brilliant, understanding outliers of behavior can be challenging. When humans behave irrationally, with anger, through deception, or other jarring actions that many times may cause harm the origin/intention of the behavior sparks curiosity. Inspired by the intention of various forms of human behavior, I wanted to create a platform that embraces the process of understanding behavior without bias, judgement or stereotypes. I wanted to see if there was a way to disrupt the classroom to prison pipeline, clean up policing in underserved communities, change behavior modification of youth in schools, and help organizations improve performance in the workplace.\n\nAs a graduate of UCLA and a former NBA athlete, my collective experiences, skill sets, and visions to create behavioral solutions have evolved and allowed me to create cutting-edge solutions that shape the body, mind and behavior of student-athletes. My new software Assessdo, created by Barin Technologies, not only offers the opportunity to support student athletes, but ideally become an interface for entities such as: educational institutions, law enforcement agencies, justice systems, healthcare providers, human resources and youth programs. Assessdo uses proprietary AI technology to predict, interpret, observe and ideally transform behavior. It can be a gateway to facilitate honest discussions with groups of any size and create a turnkey breakthrough of powerful dialogue.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to our research, there are two major challenges that interrupt behavior: 1) confirmation bias and 2) stereotype threats. Understanding why implicit bias exists and how to tackle the problem was one inspiration for creating this software. Other inspirations for creating Assessdo was: 1) noticing the influx of young people becoming incarcerated at an early age, 2) learning about the correlation of prison reform with mental health, 3) how police training is affecting rates of incarceration, wrongful deaths, and the unnecessary mistreatment of civilians, and 4) how the relationships between teachers, faculty, students, communities, and districts negatively affect school systems. We invite you to learn about our platform, as we believe there is power in understanding the whole of every person, not just parts. Our users will experience fair equity while having the ability to think and feel freely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Message From The Assessdo Creator\n\n\n\n\u00a0Contact Rodney Zimmerman - rodneyzimmerman14@gmail.com\u00a0"

It's designed to help in emergencies and save money.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt intelligently charges up when energy is cheapest. In the event of an outage, the 2.2kWh battery saves the day, powering a fridge for 1-2 days, or keeping the WiFi up for weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the first home battery truly designed for portable apartment use and living. With no permanent installation you can take it wherever you live, and it can easily be used throughout your home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a quick account setup, plug blipOne into any standard outlet to immediately begin storing energy. It\u2019s that simple: no landlords or electricians necessary. Set it and forget it. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing advanced algorithms and the free app, blipOne connects to your utility rate system. It reviews your rate plan and \u00a0takes advantage of electricity prices that change throughout the day.\nBy storing energy overnight or when the price is low, and using it to power your devices during the day when the price is highest, blip saves you money without having to turn anything off.\nThis can save you money when energy is expensive. Don\u2019t pay for high cost electricity when you could be using cheap, stored power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t be caught unprepared when blackouts or emergencies happen. Power your priority devices, some for days on end.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n* Listed hours are an approximation from standard device energy ratings and based on continuous use. Exact runtime for your devices will depend on the efficiency of your device.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep yourself, your home, and your family safe with easily accessible backup power during rolling blackouts or severe weather.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nblip energy has worked tirelessly to ensure blipOne exceeds all safety and environmental standards. It\u2019s undergone 40 reliability and safety tests and meets all required certifications.\nAC equivalent pure sine wave provides safe, quality AC power to protect your devices and electronics. We've built multiple layers of safety into the power electronics of blipOne, to go above and beyond industry safety protocols.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep an eye on your energy usage and savings while controlling blipOne, all through the app.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the blip algorithm yourself--head here and calculate the potential and projected \u00a0savings you could experience. This calculator uses the same technology as the blipOne app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy storing power, and using it during peak hours, you'll reduce your reliance on dirty energy from peaker plants, the source of most daytime power and stressors on our environment.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing blipOne will help reduce your carbon footprint without disrupting your daily routine.

Energy storage is a powerful tool for controlling your energy usage and building outage resilience for your home - and it should be widely available, not a luxury.\u00a0\n\nWe've been working on blip energy since January 2020, and in that time have won the Clean Energy prize from ASUio, filed patents and mapped out a path to certification and scale manufacturing for our first product blipOne. We've built our functional proof of concept, and are now working to lock down the final bill of materials, send out for product certification testing, and manufacture our first run of product.\n\nThe team has technical and business backgrounds in hardware development and energy. Our CEO Sophia was a Mechanical Engineer at iRobot building Roomba before receiving her MBA and MSDI from Northwestern.

My mom said her kitchen cabinet was broken and couldn\u2019t find a good carpenter\u2026That night it looked like destiny was beckoning us to think outside the box; because all of sudden the broken kitchen cabinet also had a broken leaking pipe. Our dining room was flooding\u2026We tried to reach a plumber we knew but we could not get hold of him. So we called an aunt, who called a friend, and the friend called a cousin, who called a neighbor\u2026When they finally got the plumber, they asked him, can you fix this issue tonight...his response in pidgin was, \"I Fit DO\" That was the eureka moment.\n\nSo we thought that there should be a better way for Ghanaians, both at home and Abroad, and Foreigners visiting Ghana, to get Services quickly without the Difficult Task of trying to CONTACT A FRIEND'S UNCLE'S SISTER'S NIECE'S BROTHER FOR A PLUMBER to fix a leaking pipe among other services...\"\nSo we decided to create an app called IFITDO (pidgin English) which means \"I can do it\".\u00a0:\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are solving a problem which was previously unsolvable. For many foreigners who visit Ghana, and also Ghanaians living abroad, and at those at home it is a problem finding certain services easily, quickly, and efficiently.\u00a0\n1. Difficulty in quickly finding a service provider when you need one:\nGhanaians at home and abroad, and foreigners need some service when visiting the country. \u00a0However, it is not easy to quickly find someone to provide a service.\u00a0\n\u00a02. Quickly finding someone within a 3-mile radius:\nMost people find it difficult to get someone quickly when they need service in an immediate area in a 3mile radius\n\u00a03. Service Providers not targeted to Service Seekers:\nService providers in most cases find service seekers by chance or through word of mouth referral which often limits provider's chances of getting a job. or providing a service.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Quickly and efficiently help people find services :\nA quick and efficient way to get services is by connecting service seekers with service providers.\n\u00a02. providing opportunity where there is none:\nAn easy way for students, professionals, and the unemployed to make some cash is by readily connecting them with service seekers.\n\u00a03. Community aspect:\nThe community focus on where locals are doing work for locals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating a truly unique user interface and experience for everyone who uses the app\u00a0\nOur app is bi-dimensional. Meaning we are developing it in such a way that you can be both a service seeker and service provider and experience the same exceptional experience.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Journey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0We have bootstrapped this project by developing a unique app for finding services but now we need your help to get to the finish line and make life easier for you and anyone seeking services in Ghana and eventually Africa.\u00a0\n\nMarketing: We need to get the word out there.\nInclude additional features to provide an amazing user experience.\nInfrastructure support to ensure that the app runs smoothly for you and everyone.\nProviders onboarding: hire a small team to onboard providers.\u00a0\n\nThere is so much more to do in order to successfully bring the app to users on both ios and android, and we need your help to make this happen. Thank you in advance.\n\nREWARDS:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I\u2019m an aspiring chef in the culinary field and while trying to put myself out there and gain business, I ran into slow spells. Not because my food is bad, because it\u2019s not but because nobody knew who I was or how to get connected with me. So I thought of ways that I could gain some type of exposure with something as simple as a search. I\u2019ve done research on platforms I could join or Facebook groups I can be apart of, however none of them met my needs. So that\u2019s what brought out my innovative side and I came up with Culinect, which stands for culinary connection. Culinect not only helps aspiring culinary artist like myself but also helps customers in need of culinary services. I mean think about it right, how do you currently go about getting a baker for your kids party, or getting a food truck to come to your office because you\u2019re sick of the same ole cafe food, or hiring a chef for a huge cooperate event. A lot of it is word of mouth, which is fine but let\u2019s say that artist is booked up for that date, now what ? Back to the cafe, right?\u2026. Wrong! With Culinect you can search up Culinary artist in your area for whatever it is you require services for and get connected with a pro.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

That\u2019s why its structure has been designed to stay simple, easy to carry, and easy to assemble.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re making anything with your new 3D printing sidekick, then keeping the filament running in any direction is extremely important. RENCOLOR DM-10 lets you automatically load and unload the filament of the printer in a simple click of a button. No complex instructions, no lengthy start/stop processes\u2014just straightforward convenience!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForget about limited monochrome 3D prints that don\u2019t offer you other options, forcing you to only create boring monochromatic designs. Rencolor DM-10 FDM Color 3D Printer allows you to explore the following different 3D printing modes that will literally power and brighten your creativity:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Print different layers, gradient colors, mix colors at any proportions, or go monochromatic \u2014 unlike other 3D printers, Rencolor lets you print more, better, and in more diversified ways!\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo project is the same. Some require finer details while others not so much. That\u2019s why Rencolor DM-10 doesn\u2019t force you to use only one precision level. You can instead choose from 3 precision modes of 0.1mm/0.15mm/0.2mm, adjusting the precision according to the specific requirements of your project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRencolor DM-10 features Dual Z-Axis rods and motors that dramatically improve the performance and stability of the printing process, making every movement extremely smooth and accurate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou won\u2019t need to read lengthy user guides or watch hours of tutorials to operate your Rencolor DM-10. Equipped with a clear UI touch screen interface, this sweet 3D printer is a sophisticated device that anyone can seamlessly use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Rencolor DM-10 doesn\u2019t need to be online in order to print your creations since it supports offline printing.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, if your suddenly face a power outage, your work and materials won\u2019t be lost. Rencolor DM-10 will stop when the power goes out but will conveniently resume printing precisely where the project was interrupted, re-starting the printing process\u00a0as if no unexpected interruption had happened.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe simplicity of metal and the unique features of aluminum alloy frame are given a special charisma by the striking artistic design of Rencolor DM-10. The exterior of the remote extruder is marked by an iconic red: the red color card board printing surface. The black tones of the actual machine will appeal to your aesthetical sensitivity as the contrast between two colors will support a fertile creative horizon while you use your Rencolor for spectacular creations!\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile portable and easy to assemble and use, Rencolor DM-10 is robustly built to last. This printer offers you something truly unique: a lifetime warranty. There\u2019s no better offer than that, so we hope you\u2019ll take us up on our offer!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShenzhen Ren Cai Tech Co., Ltd. has been a key research and development player in the 3D printing industry since 2016. The company's research has made great progress in 3D printing technologies such as FDM hot melt, light curing, and metal powder printing, among other technologies. We have proudly improved the FDM-3D full-color printing technology, we solved the high-precision FDM 3D printing challenges, and we made seriously important improvements to the FDM-3D printer extruder. All that work is now reflected on what we can offer you with Rencolor DM-10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 2,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $900M raised between them."

        "Text": "Why we are here:\nHi there, Kickstarter community, hope you're all well and achieving the goals you set out when joining this online community of thinkers, creators and innovators.\nThe reason why I am here is to change an idea and a beta app into a new solution for the ever-changing business world.\n\nA short story:\nA couple of months ago two colleagues\u00a0and I began our journey working on a market innovation\u00a0for the bricks and mortar\u00a0retail market; we call this little innovation\u00a0Fortuna.\nWe plan to use Fortuna as a means to foster a greater sense of community between consumers and their local enterprises, both from their local and nearby markets. This will be done by providing an inexpensive service that reduces the barriers to engagement, giving the little guys a chance\u00a0to thrive\u00a0in an ever more competitive\u00a0and centralised\u00a0environment.\n\nThe Idea:\nThe concept is simple and best said in a paraphrase of Steve Jobs' announcement of the iPod. Whereas the iPod \"fit a thousand songs in your pocket\", we want to give local small brick and mortar\u00a0stores\u00a0the ability\u00a0to \"promote their products in a thousand\u00a0pockets in an inexpensive way.\" Sounds boastful, I know. :)\nAll the above probably\u00a0sounds great, but at the same time very much like a sales pitch. I guess your team is more interested\u00a0in knowing where we currently stand and our understanding of the market.\n\nThe Business:\nFortuna is an application that is intended to provide an enhanced consumer purchasing power by locating, pricing and discovering local businesses while assisting them in increasing their sales without a substantial increase to their marketing budget.\n\nThe Market:\nFortuna's target market consists of two key consumer groups: 1) the paying clients, which would be enterprises classed as micro to medium, employing anywhere from 1-49 staff, of which there are currently 256,000; and 2) Ireland's digital citizens aged 18 and above, which amounts to 2.9 million people and growing. (This is our initial market; we have eye on global opportunities).\n\nProgress/Proof:\nFortuna is currently progressing through the late stages of bug fixing and application tune-up with a market release capacity within 2-3 months.\nFortuna is looking to expand the existing digital services for local enterprises nationwide, to facilitate a competitive market at a low cost. Examples of this could be your local takeaway or barber, spending hundreds of Euro a month on Google and Facebook marketing to get leads marketing to people which may or may not want their service, while with Fortuna it would be \u20ac10-20, with customers looking for their service based on the criteria stated above.\n\nObjectives/Future:\nFortuna's objectives are simply to provide local businesses such as corner shops, independent grocers and sole traders the same opportunities to market and promote their goods and services to their local community in a cost-effective way, giving them a level footing with the big guys.\nWithin 18 months of our launch, we plan to have a domestic consumer base of 450,000 app users with 4,000+ businesses on our platform, with further expansion globally with an end goal of 160 million users and 1,400,000+ businesses using the platform by the end of the 5th year of operation.\n\nPositive\u00a0steps:\n- MVP undergoing debugging, with market release capacity within 2-3 months.\n- Due to external market conditions the market we are entering is growing.\n- Experienced team with 15 years of working in Software Development.\n- Our team has a combined experience of 5 years of working in direct sales, marketing, customer support and problem solving (not software related issues).\n- We have a vision that goes beyond just Fortuna, but a vision for a better, more competitive market, where the business currently left behind will actual get a chance to be the best they can be."

        "Text": "https://www.autasticeducation.com/home\n\nLook, I don't know you, and yet I can pretty much guarantee that you know someone with autism. That\u2019s because roughly 1 in 60 people will be on the autism spectrum. It might be a family member, a friend, a classmate. \u00a0Almost universally, these people and their families have to fight tooth and nail to get basic access to resources like mental healthcare and education. Unfortunately, this is especially true for children with autism. \u00a0Children on the autism spectrum need a lot of therapy. \u00a0A lot! \u00a0On average they are recommended 36 hours of ABA therapy per week but at $120 per hour that would cost $225,000 per year. \u00a0No one can afford that, so these kids miss out. When they get that therapy at an early age, they make more friends, they are more likely to get a job, and they live longer. But it's a full-time job, and most insurance companies aren't going to cover those costs.\u00a0\n\nVirtually all of the cognitive skills a behavioral therapist teaches can be taught through software. Memory, \u00a0language, and \u00a0attention, contrary to our collective intuition, are the easiest tasks to teach at an early age. I worked with kids on the spectrum from 3 -23 years old, and with them in mind, designed a curriculum that can teach kids regardless of severity and regardless of age. With Autastic Education, we can give children all the therapeutic lessons they need, for $20 a month. Don't get me wrong, in-person therapy is the best option, but for most kids on the spectrum, they just aren't getting what they need. Talk to the parents, they will tell you how stressed they are, how short on time they are, and how hard they have to work to get their kids fairly basic access to healthcare.\u00a0\n\nOur team consists of Jack Seagle who has helped design and scaffold much of the core curriculum within Autastic Education, he put together our Kickstarter, and he is the co-founder of Autastic. Katie Clark is the Regional Behavior Analyst for Northeastern Utah Educational Services. With a decade of experience and several degrees and certificates behind her name, she oversees 9 school districts and 4 charter schools. In the clinic, she would be checking to make sure I am doing my job right, with our app, it's pretty much the same thing. \u00a0We go to her for data analytics and to make sure our algorithms are on point. The curriculum needs to be very precise in order to work with all kinds of different folks. With Katie and Jack, it couldn't be more precise. Finally, \u00a0me. I'm Kyle Krantz and I\u2019m a Board Certified Behavioral Technician, I work directly with the kids in the clinic. After a few years of working with kids on the spectrum, I started working on this project to help close the gap that all my clients were experiencing.\n\nI know the numbers can be confusing but try to stick with me here. We are asking for $30,000, Kickstarter is an all or nothing platform, and if we dont get all of that than we get nothing and your money is given back. With $30,000 we can cover the remaining costs of our minimum viable product(MVP). Our MVP would be roughly $60,000, for 6 lessons and several minigames, this may not sound like much but this could be roughly 1000 hours of therapy (that would normally cost $120,000) But we need much more financial backing to build all the lessons we have planned. Each lesson averages roughly $8,000. We have the algorithms, and lesson designs worked out for 25 lessons taught through a process called discrete trial training. \u00a0All of these lessons will be provided at $20 a month. \u00a0With Kickstarter funding, we can help get this ball rolling.\n\n\u00a0A good app needs to be fun, so we have lots of minigames designed and ready. A good app needs to be evidence-based, so running peer-reviewed research will be integral to our process (I'll be doing this initially but we will need to outsource later on).\u00a0Our app is designed with low functioning autism in mind, but high functioning people with autism at a young age will benefit greatly.\n\nWe prioritize the lessons we build based on their utility. The first ten lessons we will build focus on attention and memory. These lessons increase how well kiddos can learn in the future, and research metrics for these lessons are more accurate. We then begin to focus on verbal and emotional understanding. If we can get enough funding, after those 25 lessons we start working on more sophisticated approaches involving echoics, facial and voice recognition, virtual reality and much more. Much of this will require a fairly extensive amount of research and is planned for the mid to long-term.\u00a0\nIf you would like to learn more about some of the technical details, check out our website at \u00a0https://www.autasticeducation.com/home\u00a0"

It combines a battery-powered PA system and instrument amplifier simulations into one wireless, intuitive package that can be set up in seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0A portable, minimalistic system - created with a strict focus on audio quality - that is easy to set up, easy to use, and sounds awesome! Made to create fulfilling positive experiences with sound and music - whether it would be on the street corner, in the wild, at home, on a stage or wherever you would like to take it - for your artistic freedom!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Great acoustics & high quality signal processing is critical for any sound system - but it is especially important for musicians. Lets therefore jump straight into the sound of the actual system. The system is designed for both vocal & Stringed instruments.\u00a0\nYou can find all samples of the speaker, modules & effects at the bottom of the page, or in the SOUNDCLOUD Link:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSharing your music has never been so easy! No complex cabling, extra pre-amps, or time-consuming setups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0The Kombo Sound System is comprised of three main components: a speaker, a module, and a transmitter, which combined together give you the opportunity to practice, play, and perform anywhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0The Transmitters & modules are bundled together in connectivity packages - which provide a tailored, wireless solution for whatever instrument you are playing. \u00a0At launch we have the microphone package, and the string instrument package - each with unique features and high quality signal processing.\n\n\n\nString instrument package left - Microphone package right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0The transmitters transmit your instrument/microphone signals wirelessly in high quality (24 bit/48 Khz) and without any noticeable latency. At launch we have two transmitter types, each paired with the corresponding Module.\n\nString transmitter\nThe string transmitter is equipped with a jack connection made for electric string instruments. Additionally, if you have ever experienced your acoustic guitar sounding \"thin\" from your amplifier, the transmitter is equipped to fix this with the Phase switch.\n\nMicrophone transmitter\nThe microphone transmitter is equipped with an XLR connection made for microphones, and includes a +48V Phantom power switch so you can use all of your microphones.\u00a0\n\n\n\nOn the image is our prototype\n\n\nThe 5.2/5.8 Ghz radio system supports 8 channels, enabling you to connect up to 8 instruments at once (Requires 4 KOMBO Speakers to connect 8 instruments in a stack).\u00a0\nYou should also not worry about dropping them either as they are sturdy and made of fiber-reinforced ABS.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n String transmitter left, Microphone transmitter right. \n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation of the transmitter prototype\n\n\n\n\n\nPrototype of transmitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0The Modules let you combine all the effects you need.\u00a0\nAt launch, we offer a module for electric stringed instruments, and another for vocals & other microphone duties - The String Module and The Microphone Module.\n\n\n\nPictures are of prototype modules\n\n\nThe modules are powered by the speaker as soon as you connect them through the robust magnetic latching system.\nThe modules internal memory saves your settings and loads them for your next playing session.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe module's interface can be easily navigated with the ring & parameter selectors. You simply select the parameter you want to adjust through the parameter selector buttons and adjust the parameter by turning the ring - with the level indicated by the LEDs.\n\n\n\nOn the image is our prototype\n\n\nThe string module is fitted with amp selector, which allows you to select an acoustic amp, electric guitar amp, or bass amp - each with their own signal processing path.\n\n\n\nOn the image is our prototype\n\n\nThe microphone module is equipped with its own effect suite, including the most popular vocal processing effects & EQ optimized for vocals.\n\nThe Modules each have a powerful, built-in M7 ARM processor, running our proprietary signal processing & amp/cap simulations. The signal processing is developed by our partners in the Audio & Music Effect development company Shift Audio (look at the bottom of the page for samples of processing)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fully mixed and processed signal from the Modules is instantly transmitted to the Speakers through our proprietary wireless interface (Li-Sound interface).\n\n\n\nOn the image is our prototype\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0By snapping the Modules on the Speaker, you can turn the Speaker into a fully-fledged guitar/bass amplifier, vocal amplifier, or both. Additionally, the speakers are modular, enabling you to stack up to six speakers together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe device has a minimalistic style, sturdy construction, and an easy-to-navigate interface.\nEach Speaker has four module connection points (two on the backside and one on each side), meaning four instruments can be connected to one speaker alone.\n\n\n\nSpeaker prototype\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe speaker is designed specifically to survive rough life expected for live gigging equipment. \u00a0The enclosure is made out of 12mm plywood and High-Pressure Laminate. Beyond the sturdy enclosure, the speaker is surrounded by a protective rubber frame that protects against bumps & hits.\u00a0\nAdditionally, the speaker has a 3 mm anodized aluminum mesh, keeping the driver safe - no matter what would be thrown at it.\nThe speaker weighs 13 Kilograms, including a battery.\u00a0\nThe speaker is compatible with a standard 35 mm pole mount.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe included 95 Wh battery can both be charged while the speaker is playing, and be swapped on the run - giving you the power you need to keep your performance going wherever.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have a playtime of up to 40 hours depending on the usage, which means you could play several gigs in one day without having to charge in-between.\nAdditional batteries are available for purchase so that you can swap batteries in situations that might require it.\nAdditionally, the battery level indicator makes it easy to check up on the battery`s power.\nA battery can be charged fully in 1.7 hours with the included power supply.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nA High quality sound is critical for any speaker, \u00a0but especially important when it is designed for musicians. The Kombo sound system is therefore designed and engineered with help from the highly respected Danish Audio industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnapshots from the development process of the KOMBO Speakers Acoustics\n\n\nThe custom Dual voice coil, 8\u201d Co-Axial driver, and a Smooth compression tweeter \u00a0enables a linear & clean output from 60 Hz, to 20kHz, making it perfect as a full range amplification system.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a video of how the sample recordings where conducted (Audio in video not recorded through microphones).\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the acoustic package, The Speaker is also equipped with a custom 160W (Peak) Class-D amplifier, with just 1% distortion at max volume.\nThrough this setup the speaker can output 110 dB max SPL @ 1 meter, enabling you to power just about any gig. Additionally, you can always boost the output power by stacking more speakers together.\n\n\n\nSound pressure through stacking of speakers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Kombo Systems' unique communication interface allows stacked speakers to automatically calibrate key acoustic parameters - so that you can focus on the music.\nThese calibrations include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe speakers are modular, meaning that they instantly connect to other Kombo Sound System Speakers when stacked so that you and your friends can create different setups to power bigger gigs! You can stack up to six speakers and connect them to eight wireless instruments and modules.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis unique moularity is enabled through our patent pending Li-Sound interface.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the Speaker supports Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity which allows you to use the Speaker for streaming and enjoying music from your favorite artists, as well as jamming to your favorite songs or performing with a backing track.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the back panel, you find the master volume knob and analog inputs. An instrument input (1/4'' TS), line input (1/4'' TRS), XLR input (for dynamic microphones), A mute button (Mutes all inputs to the speaker), a USB charging port (for charging your transmitter if needed or ex phones) and lastly the USB service port, which allows you to update the device`s firmware.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Master level knob works both as an ON/OFF button and master level adjuster, while the surrounding LED indicator helps indicate the chosen power level.\n\n\n\nOn the image is our prototype\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe TS instrument input is configured with a Pre-Amplifier, designed specifically for you to connect your electro-acoustic guitar.\nThe TRS input is a balanced mono input, designed for Pro level signal types.\nThe Microphone XLR input is equipped with a high-quality Pre-Amplifier.\nAll inputs are fed to a high quality, 24 bit/48 Khz ADC. Through this setup, all analog inputs are mixed into the same Li-Sound stream as attached modules.\n\n\n\n\n\nRadio, WiFi, and Bluetooth transmissions are commonly used traditional wireless music equipment but are not always optimal. We are proud to have developed a brand new and innovative way of transmitting audio without latency or high power consumption, while still keeping the cables at bay. Introducing our proprietary Li Sound Technology \u00a0- a brand new way of fast, optic audio transmission. The Technology is currently patent pending.\u00a0\nThere are many benefits in using this interface compared to regular wireless interfaces.\n\n\n\nOn the image is our prototype\n\n\nThe Li-Sound connection works between Modules & Speakers, while the transmitter & modules communicate through a powerfull radio interface - so you can move about, free of wires or worries!\n\n\n\nOn the image is our prototype\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment HUB\nAll Kickstarter Backers will get access to the exclusive Kombo Audio development & Design Hub.\u00a0\n\nThrough this hub, we will be interacting with you (Backers), for feedback on the product decisions, new product ideas & input on functionality - both for current and future products.\u00a0\n\nSpecial Offers\nBeyond the reduced product price on Kickstarter, early KS backers will get Early access, and special offers on all new product launches.\u00a0\n\nEarly Delivery\nWe have secured stock for the first 150 bundles, which will all be reserved for Kickstarter backers. Unfortunately, any order beyond the first 150 bundles will experience delays due to the current global part shortage. Early Kickstarter backers will therefore get the product in their hands much earlier than anyone else.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Kombo system is designed with modularity in mind. We will therefore, post launch, be launching a wide range of new modules - each of which enables you to do more with live music, with less complexity.\n\nThese products are currently not under development, but are in the pipeline - and will be designed in collaboration with the KOMBO Development Hub community.\u00a0\n\nRecording Module\nWe want to create an easy to use recording / looper module, which enables users to record their live performances through the Li-Sound interface, and instantly stream these through a smartphone. The estimated launch time for this product is 2024.\n\nModule With VST support\nAnother pipelined product is a VST connected module, through which users can add effects, and and adjusts these easily through a VST converter. The estimated launch time for this product is 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0We are a small startup based in Denmark, consisting of musicians and engineers, developing an audio system for Live concerts & performances. Our focus is to bring innovative solutions to the Audio and Music market, and simplify the use of complex audio technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnapshot of some of the programs Kombo Audio has participated in.\n\n\n\nThe Kombo Audio Team has been selected to participate in some of the most prestigious accelerator & incubator programs that Denmark has to offer.\u00a0\nKombo is currently participating in the biggest accelerator program, Danish Tech challenge, which hosts the most promising startups across the nation.\u00a0\nAdditionally, the team is located in the Danish Technical University`s campus with access to absolute world class facilities & experts in the acoustic industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some of the beautiful moments from Kombo Audios development story.\n\n\n\nMoments from the Kombo Sound system development process\n\n\nEarly revision of the String Instrument package:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that all items shown throughout the campaign are prototypes.

        "Text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prototype of CNC Shaperoo 2025 was created as a successor to the Chinese CNC 3018 platform. The design was based on the assumption that the machine would have a similar workspace, but with significantly better rigidity, machining speed performance, and adjustable power of the AC-powered spindle. In short, the enormous power of a real milling machine was enclosed in a compact housing that fits on a workbench.\n\n\n\n\n\nBEGINNERS\u00a0\nIf you are new to milling, it is not a problem because the assembly of the machine is easy and you will be assisted by our instructional videos. They will guide you from folding, through setup, to running the machine and processing material.\nADVANCED\nShaperoo is also designed for users who require precision machining. This is ensured by a rigid frame, refined and dedicated electronics, and years of our experience in designing and building CNC machines.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nCNC machines, as well as 3D printers, provide many possibilities for creation. Compared to similarly priced machines, Shaperoo is extremely powerful and precise.\u00a0\n\nFor this reason, the CNC is the ideal machine for the do-it-yourselfer and the person who likes DIY. You can see examples of very simple DIY works in our videos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEngraving and cutting aluminium is also no problem for our machine.\n\n\n\nProcess of milling alluminium 6061\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore advanced DIY and electronics enthusiasts may be interested in creating PCBs, for which our machine is also very well suited.\n\n\n\nProcess of milling PCB's\n\n\n\n\n\nSample of circiut made by Shaperoo2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNC system board based on Arduino nano 328, compatible with GRBL 1.1 and Estlcam.\n\n \u00a0The board allows to control CNC machines using GRBL, Estlcam, or Chilipeppr firmware. Optically isolated inputs and outputs provide overvoltage protection on Arduino module ports while ensuring stable operation.\nIn addition to the typical leads for the GRBL, the laser, air assist, and PWM 0-10V connectors were also brought out. All three axes operate with backlash-canceling trapezoidal screws, allowing precise milling of even such complex tasks as circuit boards.\u00a0\n\n\n\nMain Board by Shaperoo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStepper Board by Shaperoo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, it is possible! Thanks to a dedicated speed controller designed and manufactured by us, it is possible to adjust the spindle speed in the range of 10 000 - 20 000 RPM directly from control software (GRBL Candle, Estlcam).\n\n\n\nAC PWM Controller by Shaperoo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks to the measuring functions built into the software, it is possible to measure the surface and angular displacement of the workpiece.This functionality is particularly useful when milling PCBs, providing a constant cavity, eliminating surface irregularities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTool lenght measurment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Estlcam software allows you to control the machine from a PC. Using its full potential, we have added a remote control to the machine to facilitate precise guidance of the spindle to the start position.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYears of experience in working with CNC machines allowed us to design a device that is easy to assembly, affordable but still very accurate.\u00a0\nThe base of the construction is made of L-type aluminum profiles, which provide rigidity to the whole machine. . Structural elements are made in 3D printing technology, with gyroid filling no less than 50%. As a result, we deliver high-quality and durability elements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike most CNC's, the Shaperoo has a shielded work area so 95% of the chips stay inside, this allows for a safer and cleaner work area. In case of an emergency there is an emergency stop button on the front of the machine.\n\n\n\nShaperoo2025 has protective glass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's been a while since we started working on our machine. Shaperoo 2025 is still a prototype, but the progress that has been made since the first version is enormous. The biggest achievements of this work are the development of our own controller boards, spindle PWM, tool length measurement and table mapping. In the future we plan to develop an attachable laser and we are open to suggestions.\u00a0\n\n\n\nPrototype of Shaperoo 2025 \n\n\n\n\n\nFinal version\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0On Shaperoo you will be able to process:\n\nMDF\nHDF\nWood\nPlywood\nPlexi ( PMMA )\nGlass laminate ( PCB )\nRubber\nPVC\nAcrylic\u00a0\n\nHere are sample processing parameters on our machine:\n\n\u00a0Wood:\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feed rate: 800 to 1200mm/min\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Depth of cut: 1.5 to 2 mm\n\u00a06061 Aluminum:\u00a0 \u00a0\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feed rate: 800 to 1200mm/min\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Depth of cut: 0.08 to 0.1 mm\n\u00a0Acrylic:\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feed rate: 500 to 1000mm/min\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Depth of cut: 1 to 1.5 mm\n\u00a0PVC:\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feed rate: 800 to 1200\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Depth of cut: 1.5mm to 2mm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe ship Shaperoo 2025 kits worldwide, but please note that the machine is designed to be plugged into 230V 50Hz mains.

        "Text": "Wild Streets is a free augmented reality app that combines scientific data and high-quality 3D models of trees and plants to allow people to co-create the green, inclusive cities of tomorrow. More than ever, we need cities that offer green, healthy, usable spaces from micro parks sprinkled across neighbourhoods to green high-streets and super bicycle pathways connecting every corner of a city - and they ought to be shaped by the people they are intended for. Wild Streets is a tool that will help people reimagine their cities. It celebrates people\u2019s differences and enables place-makers in creating spaces that unify and incorporates the needs and wishes of all. The app takes public engagement and awareness building on the benefits of urban nature to a whole new level.\nAt the same time, Wild Streets harnesses the power of aggregated social data to inform decision-makers and planners about locals' preferences for green infrastructure - putting citizens at the centre of urban development. Limits to funding, awareness, and time are interrelated factors that compromise the quality of urban greening as they impede the decision-making of everyone involved. Wild Streets offers a cost- and time-effective tool that enables municipalities, organisations, and companies of all budgets to meet citizens at street level.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's an ambitious project. That's why we've teamed up with two award-winning companies, Norgram and Set Snail, who have the expertise needed to bring the Wild Streets vision to life. We're also proud to be joining forces with i-Tree and Treeconomics, both drivers in the UK and internationally of the study of the multi-dimensional benefits of urban trees. To ensure that the app and our services are designed in a way that enables us to meet our objectives, we've assembled three incredible subject-focused advisory boards. A supervisory board will help us grow our geographical reach and scope in an organic and sustainable man\n\n\n\n\n\nWild Streets is a not-for-profit association registered in Denmark (CVR no. 39872595).\u00a0\nEmpowering People to Green the Urban Landscape\nImagine if you could adapt your city right here and now; if those dull, grey streets could be your canvas. The work commute could be as pleasant as a walk in the park. Your surroundings could be tailored to suit your everyday needs for places to take a break, eat that lunch, let the kids roam around safely, and exercise in a calm setting with cleaner, healthier air. Those familiar spaces could look and feel like they never have before.\nUsing Apple's augmented reality technology, the Wild Streets app will blur the line between how our cities are and what could be. We're inviting you to green your streets, squares, bike paths, back alleys, rooftops, and every other little opportune corner of your city, with lush, beautiful 3D vector trees and plants.\nBesides having fun creating the city of your dreams, we want you to share it with the world. Wild Streets allows other people to step into your ideas by letting them reload your green creation at the same location, comment on it, iterate on the design, and share it with even more people including those in a position to make it happen. By including users' social data, we are also bridging the gap between locals, those who design our public spaces, and those who have the final say about their development. No more publicly displayed still images showing picture-perfect renders of urban landscapes nobody had a say on: planners will be able to see what people really want - across genders, ages, ethnicity - and people will be able to take official proposals to the test in the real-time world.\nWelcome to the green, inclusive cities of tomorrow!\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Why Wild Streets?\u00a0\nIf we can harness our collective imagination and show it to the world, we don't need to accept the way things are, or even tweak the details. It's high time for a step-change into the future we want to live in. How green could your city be, how would it feel to think of streets as parks, how would it change the way you and your family live now and into a climate uncertain future?\nIn 2020, the world as we know it changed for most of us. It got a lot smaller in many ways, and we have been forced to interact differently with our surroundings. The quality of our neighborhoods, access to nature, and the feeling of a space have all proven to be critical factors to people's mental and physical health in a time where lockdowns have mainly kept us at home or in our immediate surroundings.\nAs we gradually adapt to new normals and return to old ones, these factors are likely to play a big role in how we perceive and make use of our cities. It has become clear that (nearby) access to green space for exercise, social gathering, and quiet self-reflection is scarce at best. And the design of such spaces is narrow and not accommodating the needs of everyone. People's awareness of the quality of the air they breathe has also come into focus, or there is at least ample opportunity to instill it.\nAllowing locals to shape their neighbourhoods and the places they work and play according to their needs is perhaps more than ever a timely opportunity to shape inclusive, considered cities. With the significant loss of power that people have experienced over their everyday life in 2020, there is a new willingness to take part in the reshaping of urban spaces - co-creation has the potential to empower people to take control of this process.\nThe current crisis has amplified the reasons why the design of our cities is not fit to deal with what remains one of the greatest challenges of our time. Climate change has a visible impact on our lives, with urban temperatures fluctuating between extremes and nature in an unprecedented decline. Many cities are hotspots of biodiversity and use natural solutions to keep cool, prevent floods, deflect pollution, and calm winds. Today, nine in ten people worldwide live in places where air pollution levels exceed guideline limits by the World Health Organization, causing more than 7 million deaths every year. With the world\u2019s urban population continuing its rapid climb to 68 percent by 2050, the transformation towards green, low-carbon cities is critical.\nUrban forests and nature in general, play a pivotal role in this, but current planting efforts in many cities are not happening at the rate they could. Wherever people have been given a voice in planning their city through measures such as participatory budgeting, there has been a clear call for greener surroundings. These can't be only top-down decisions either, the people who live in and use the streets every day need to have a say, and have a sense of ownership over what for some is their garden. There is an urgent need for solutions that enable the co-creation of tomorrow\u2019s sustainable, green cities in the image of the people that inhabits them and that supports the rising willingness and activism among citizens to help bring about this transition. To that willingness, we offer Wild Streets.\nHow it works\nUtilising the revolutionary possibilities of AR (augmented reality), Wild Streets will enable\u00a0users to green any location in real-time with simple drag\u2019n\u2019drop of true-to-scale 3D plants, trees, and street fixtures to whatever surroundings they view through their mobile device. Just like other AR apps, Wild Streets will measure\u00a0relative heights, depths, and distances, presenting users with realistic limitations to where items can be placed. Ultimately, Wild Streets will allow users to experience their own and others' green designs, take selfies of themselves in it and share it with the world on social media. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe functionalities of Wild Streets are straightforward! The following mock-ups are concept sketches of the app's design that help us communicate the project with knowledge partners, advisory board members, and our B2B network. The final UI and UX designs will be developed by our talented development team and will look very different from these sketches, in terms of both visuals and wording, but this is how the concept works:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have made a prototype that demonstrates a simplified, raw version of the tree-placing functionality, how detailed the 3D vector trees are, and how easily one can reimagine any space. However, it is but a proof-of-principle prototype, and the full version of the app will look and feel completely different both in terms of design and the resolution and detailing of the trees, and feature many additional functionalities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0A stunning visual experience\nTo give users the most realistic experience, we'll be working with the award-winning vegetation software of Speedtree to create 3D trees and plants vectors. Think Avatar and Star Wars and their incredible landscapes, those are the quality of Speedtree's vector models! Using their software, we can model stunning, lifelike trees and plants as it taps into substantive databases of textures, enables the configuration of species-specific characteristics such as leaves, flowers, seeds, height, spread, branch length, branching angles, and bark texture. It is also possible to change the season, add wind effects as well as directional lighting on leaves and the tree surface. Believe us, it's immersive - you'll find yourself trying to touch the trees!\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nOther elements for placemaking\nTaking a stroll in a green space is lovely, but placing a bench amongst it would open up loads of new ways to spend time there. It's not surprising that greenery and street fixtures are closely related design parameters for urban planning. The selection of greenery for a location may very well depend on its intended purpose and hence any placed furniture and fixtures.\nIn general, preferences to street fixtures vary substantially across demographic groups and life situations; elderly are likely to need more comfortable seating compared to children who generally want something fun to play on! Including street furniture in the app enables considered placemaking - and will help planners understand what people need and want and from their city.\nThis is why we'll be continuously collaborating with environmentally conscious producers of seriously smart (and stylish!) solutions for outdoor benches, cycle parking, street separators, playground- and sports facilities, and other elements that just make a city work better. We will have the same high requirements for the visual quality of the 3D models of these products as we do for our tree and plant vectors.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Where to use it\nThe more we speak to people about Wild Streets, the more potential opportunities come up for things it makes possible. Organisations representing a wide range of urban interests, along with councils and companies in the business of placemaking are keen to use Wild Streets to create awareness about their work and to help them achieve their goals. Here're just a few examples of uses of the app:\n\n\n\n\n\nPowered by data\nWhat makes Wild Streets so powerful - and ambitious! - is its usage of high-quality, and to the extent possible, real-time data. The app uses locally sourced data to make geo-specific recommendations for greenery that will thrive based on climate and ecology. Why does that matter? While it's clear that mango trees won't be too happy in the cold Scandinavian winter, it may surprise you to know to what extent choosing the right tree for the right place can have huge beneficial impacts on your neighbourhood. Research shows that trees have the ability to significantly reduce the risk of flooding, improve air quality, bring back wildlife, grow food, increase the amenity value, reduce temperature extremes and help people cope with stress - just to mention a few amazing features.\u00a0\nOur demands to the data we use are critical for the overall usability of the app, for making it a trustworthy source for councils and place makers, and what distinguishes it from gimmicky AR apps. At launch, the algorithm powering the Wild Streets app will feature a selection of carefully considered indicators from well renowned and trusted data sources to suggest the right trees for the right place.\u00a0We have prioritised these indicators based on in-depth conversations with foresters and researchers. Over time, we aspire to expand our algorithm with indicators expressive of more structurally complicated site-specific conditions as well as estimated benefits from tree planting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's all about communication\nCreating awareness\nOur algorithm will be hard at work in the background, processing thousands of data entries, while leaving you to play and have fun designing your city. We know from experience that communicating knowledge on sustainability is an incredibly hard task; the issues are complex and their implications are difficult to cope with. If we were to present people with technical information on all of the specific challenges and conditions of a location that they're thinking about greening, we'd lose 95 percent of them. And we want to get everybody excited and involved in greening up their cities!\u00a0\nKey to the development of the Wild Streets app has therefore been to understand what tickles people when it comes to urban placemaking, and to partner up with the best strategic design team out there. With a laser focus on engagement, Wild Streets will seamlessly navigate users through the human and ecological benefits of their amazing designs. Of course, there will also be opt-in options for more detailed information for users who are interested.\u00a0\nManaging expectations\nThrough our many conversations with people in the urban planning field, it has become clear that an integrated in-app measure is needed to cope with people's expectations of a design created with Wild Streets. Because the reality is that the app and its data do not offer a blueprint for what is actually possible without the consideration of an experienced forester, and no matter how wonderful a design turns out and how many likes it gets on social media, no one is obligated to make it happen. That said, seeing is believing, and Wild Streets brings ideas so much closer to reality.\nWild Streets uses the best available data to present users with flora that are likely to suit local site conditions and help tackle local challenges. We are developing a 'Confidence Index' that will give a transparent picture of the availability and quality of data for any given location. Through this index, we are also hoping to encourage more data collection and entrepreneurship.\u00a0\nDesign campaigns\nDesign campaigns are tailored, in-app areas made for design surveys of\u00a0specific geographical locations, and with respect to special social and/or environmental concerns. In a nutshell, design campaigns invite the public to have a direct say in current/ongoing greening projects. They feature tailored pop-up messages, surveys, and optimised tree/plant bundles for a specific theme. Actually, there will be many more available features and we'll keep adding more as we go!\nThis feature of the app has been designed with councils, architects, and developers in mind to do good public engagement for local greening and building projects from the hyper-local level to master-planning. Users will be able to have a say on what they would like to have featured in an area, and respond to and iterate upon design proposals right at the beginning of the process.\nA campaign can have multiple rounds of engagement! For example, citizens can be asked to provide general ideas for a place or give feedback on pre-commissioned landscape design, then once all that feedback has been digested by planners, citizens can have another go on an optimised design. In this way, you increase people's sense of ownership of a place and the quality of the result. People are likely to be more committed to the process, and in using and looking after the place which is created as a result.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Expect a lot of augmented reality fun with app-wide global campaigns as well, where we will focus on international awareness days celebrating nature, climate, biodiversity, urbanism, sports as well as physical and mental health.\u00a0You will never know what surprises we might let loose when placing a tree!\nSo what happens to people's designs?\nAs important and powerful as the engagement and awareness experience is from just using the app, the true value of Wild Streets is in the data it collects and the output it generates. We want people's beautiful designs and ideas for their cities to go somewhere where change can happen.\u00a0Based on the conversations we've had with many future users, we're launching the app with different outputs tailored to citizens and to clients (municipalities, organisations, companies).\u00a0\nVisual outputs\nCitizens\nThe visual output available to people will be fairly simple as their interest mainly is in experiencing their own and other users' designs in real-time and in formats commonly shared on social media. By enabling people to share high-quality videos or photos ('selfie' or not), it inspires others to have a say. This raises the bar of ambition for decision-makers, and having seen what people need and want, there is a public accountability to use that knowledge and make ideas come to life. It changes the conversation between citizens and councils from opposition to proposition, to help make supporting voices as loud as protesting ones are today.\u00a0\nClients\nClients as a group have more differing needs in the formats they access and review users' design submissions in, depending on their profession. How clients can explore the app's output matters a great deal to the potential societal impact of Wild Streets. The diagram below illustrates the various types of visual output formats that future users have expressed interest in. Clients also get access to a dashboard through which they can receive your designs, showing what green space the people want and where, and how much value all the ideas would bring if they were made.\u00a0\nShared designs and some basic aggregated info about the characteristics of the people who made them give organisations and councils everywhere a really useful database to make better decisions about green spaces for a particular community. So that even if there are few designs shared in a particular place or project, designers might know, for example, that people of a certain sort of age, ethnicity, and gender tend to prefer spaces that feel safe, smell and look beautiful, have playgrounds, and have amazing green pathways for sports.\n\n\n\n\n\nData output\u00a0\nCitizens & clients\nThe data output presented to the users is carefully chosen to be engaging but not to overwhelm and risk that they don't complete a design or delete the app. The app will suggest other local designs for the user to explore based not only on geographic location but also on shared social characteristics, building a local awareness of what the community wants. For awareness-raising and engagement, the app will feature estimated values of the ecosystem services delivered by the design.\nClients\nAlongside the visual design recommendations from users, Wild Streets will also generate data useful to clients. These include the ecosystem services of a user's designs and the cumulative effect of these for a defined geographic area.\nThe app collects demographic data on age, gender, nationality, ethnicity, location, and whether people have children or live with handicaps. By cross-referencing preferences for greenery; such as formality, naturalism, species choice, or functionality with information about the types of users that preferred them, a designer/planner can better cater to the needs of different communities or types of individuals.\nSuch data will be available in aggregated form to allow clients to see whether a survey campaign has been inclusive or reached the desired demographic groups. Naturally, data protection and privacy are key, and users' personal information will be protected.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's gonna be a learning curve, for sure, as to what kind of output people need to make Wild Streets serve them best. Luckily, the app collects plenty of data behind the scenes that we can use to continuously create new exiting outputs to accommodate people's wishes\nWild Streets as a facilitator for urban greening\nIrrespective of your motivations for using the app, we will do everything we can to help make citizens' visions come true. Not only does anyone working in not-for-profit placemaking have free, unlimited access to citizens' designs, but the real magic is unlocked when they can see what sort of people make what sort of designs (free as well!). That's the foundation for inclusive placemaking. A lot of effort will be put into distributing these insights and visuals to our growing international network of councils and organisations enabling them to make considered decisions.\u00a0\nAnd don't worry, we take privacy very seriously. \u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0Inviting our community to shape the app\u00a0\nIt is thanks to in-depth conversations with placemakers from councils, interested organisations, and companies - the people who work on the ground and directly with citizens on greening our cities - that Wild Streets looks the way it does today. Going forward, it makes sense to us that those who are going to apply the app also should have a strong say on what it has to offer. We are inviting our community of placemakers to co-create the app and the complementing services, be part of beta-testing, and have a real impact on the product development process. We believe this will increase the chances for citizens' designs to be realised.\nWhere will the app be available?\nWild Streets will be\u00a0globally available from its release day. However, it is planned to officially launch in the UK where the concept was born with the most complete data, most tree species, the highest confidence index and many partnerships for data, grassroots engagement, and professional deployment. A soft launch will follow shortly after in a select city in the US. These locations will have the highest 'Confidence Index' (data coverage and quality) and hence see a higher accuracy of the app's tree-selection tool and ecosystem benefit calculations. As one example: while the app is powered with global air quality data from Plume Labs, a recognised global data provider, UK/US data authorities will provide more precise local information.\nThe implications for the app's usability elsewhere straight after launch depend on whether or not a country belongs to the same 'world climate region' as the UK - the light green area in the map below.\u00a0These areas stand a good chance of being hospitable to the initial set of trees, though those species might not be the most obvious choices for the local ecology.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile our global data providers feed the app with location-specific information, certain assumptions will be made for countries belonging to the UK's 'cool temperate moist' region. We may also be able to make certain assumptions for other regions with similar hardiness characteristics. This will be decided following advice from our Scientific Advisory Board and Knowledge Partners.\nAny country belonging to the other world climate regions will see a lower Confidence Index and will still be able to access a selection of tree species that are known to those regions. However, the selection tool will not be 'active' as data coverage is simply too low to make an informed recommendation. For these countries, Wild Streets will, nevertheless, still be a powerful engagement and placemaking tool.\n\n\n\n\n\n...and when?\u00a0\nWe have defined 1 year from funding being secured until the fully tested app is ready for release. In the testing stages, councils, companies, and organizations in our network will get the chance to apply Wild Streets in real life and help us perfect the app. Do you want to get your hands on the beta-version too? Sign up for our newsletter here.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nBudget\nWild Streets is an ambitious project using some of the best people in their fields - as you might have suspected by now, it is not possible to develop a full-scale version of the app for just \u20ac50.000. In fact, the whole project is estimated to cost \u20ac1.628.000. These numbers have been subject to countless revisions as we have optimized our MVP (minimum viable product), giving enough space for our team of developers to work with Apple and our knowledge/data providers to get the app working flawlessly. Here's how we'll spend the money:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWith your help, we can get the work started and get the funding ball rolling. Once you pledge, you'll be invited to join a Substack space, where we'll share exclusive behind-the-scenes videos from the developers' desk, live streams with the Wild Streets team, and other goodies including future features that we're currently keeping under wraps. You'll also get a real say in the development of the app from day 1 through polls and demos. This is a tool for co-design, and we'll be co-designing the app itself too.\nFor every stretch goal we reach, we'll make additional features available or enhance existing ones - available at launch or within 1 year thereof. \u00a0Once we've reached Goal 10, we'll announce additional goals and the exciting features they come with.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to Kickstarter, we're also pursuing large sponsors to meet the full funding we need to create and launch. We will keep you updated on our funding progress outside Kickstarter, so you can how close we are to our goals.\nWhat if we collect more than we need?\u00a0\nThe more funding we get, the more we have to develop additional features and services to kick Wild Streets off with and to plan amazing launch events with. Wild Streets is a not-for-profit organization and everything we earn will be funneled into enhancing the user experience, our offerings to placemakers, and launching full data versions of the app in other countries. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe rewards\nWhen pledging to Wild Streets, you are pledging towards your future. Our Kickstarter rewards are all connected to the Wild Streets app, meaning by default that no rewards become available before the full app is fully financed and developed. But when it is ready, there will be a treasure chest of rewards.\u00a0\nBelow you will see the rewards available - once you make a pledge, we invite you to become a lifetime member of our community, meaning that you will get early access to new releases, pre-sets, fun filters and animated hidden surprises, green-screen persona appearances (oh yes!), and many more engaging surprises. We will also share exclusive behind-the-scenes and making-of videos during the development of the app.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHead to our website at www.wildstreets.org if you're interested in a personalised reward or already have an idea for a green commissioned project.\nSo who are we\nWe are currently a small team of two but it feels like we are many more because of our committed network and advisors with huge collective experience and wisdom between them. Once our budget is secured, our team will grow to five as we will need an innovative developer who can continue the product development, a data-wizard, and a social media/PR whirlwind fluent in engagement.\n\n\n\n\n\nContact \u00a0\nSomething that does not make sense? Or simply curious to know more? Maybe you (and your neighborhood) want to be part of the beta-testing community, or you're sitting on data that could benefit the app? Or maybe you have a specific idea for collaboration.\nFeel free to reach out to us with any inquiry - big or small - by writing us at founder@wildstreets.org or calling us at +45 31 20 74 90."

        "Text": "Hello people, wir wollen den gesamten dritten Wirtschaftssektor digitalisieren. Was bedeutet das? Nun, Deutschland ist ein Land, welches von Dienstleistungen gepr\u00e4gt ist; beim Friseurbesuch, im Nagelstudio, in einer Therme, in einer Sauna oder beim Handwerker, alles sind Dienstleistungen. \u00a0Um diese Dienstleistungen und viele mehr in Anspruch zu nehmen, wird oft ein Termin ben\u00f6tigt, welcher nach wie vor noch \u00fcberwiegend am Telefon vereinbart wird und dieses Vorgehen kostet Zeit, Geld und kann die Qualit\u00e4t der Dienstleistung mindern. Mit unserer App soll sich das \u00e4ndern!\nLaut einer Umfrage, welche von der Forsa durchgef\u00fchrt wurde, warten viele Menschen in Deutschland nur darauf, Dienstleistungen im Internet zu buchen. Wir haben daf\u00fcr eine Marktplatz-L\u00f6sung entwickelt, welche dies erm\u00f6glichen soll\u00a0und auf vollst\u00e4ndiger Transparenz basiert. Der Kunde kann sich jedes Angebot, von jedem Dienstleister und mit allen Extras anschauen und vergleichen, bis er das richtige Angebot gefunden hat. Der Dienstleister hingegen hat nur einen monatlichen Festpreis zu zahlen und braucht somit keine Angst vor versteckten Mehrkosten haben und kann die Preise im Internet genau so anbieten wie vor Ort. Hinzu kommt, dass wir die wichtigsten drei Aspekte, welche sich die befragten gew\u00fcnscht umgesetzt haben, diese sind:\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 Die Kunden w\u00fcnschen sich eine hohe \u00dcberschaubarkeit: ServiceAtHome bietet durch seinen Aufbau eine fast intuitive Nutzung sodass unser Marktplatz f\u00fcr Dienstleistungen einem Marktplatz f\u00fcr Produkte gleicht.\n2. An zweiter Stelle\u00a0ist die durchg\u00e4ngige Erreichbarkeit des Marktplatzes und die 24/7-M\u00f6glichkeit der Terminbuchung gefordert. ServiceAtHome ist durch seine online Pr\u00e4senz immer erreichbar und selbst bei St\u00f6rungen oder anbahnenden St\u00f6rungen sind bereits Alternativen vorbereitet und werden f\u00fcr eine gute Erreichbarkeit der Seite eingesetzt.\n3. Die drittst\u00e4rkste Forderung von Kunden ist, dass eine Terminbuchung online Zeit spart im Vergleich zu den \u00fcblichen\u00a0oft genutzten Telefonen. ServiceAtHome erm\u00f6glicht einen Termin zu buchen in nur wenigen Klicks. Die Terminbest\u00e4tigung erh\u00e4lt sowohl der Kunde als auch der Dienstleister direkt nach der Bezahlung.\n\nMit der neuen App k\u00f6nnen wir alle Aspekte und noch vieles mehr noch besser umsetzen. So wird auch eine Integrierung des Termins in einem digitalen Kalender eines Drittanbieters, von Kunden als Pluspunkt gesehen, was ebenfalls eingebaut werden soll.\nDer n\u00e4chste positive Effekt, welcher entsteht, ist der, dass bei vielen kleineren Dienstleistern der Arbeitsprozess durch ein Telefonklingeln gest\u00f6rt wird. Mit unserer App kann man sich voll und ganz auf den Kunden konzentrieren und die h\u00f6chste Qualit\u00e4t erbringen.\u00a0\nAbschlie\u00dfend wollen wir auch die Werbung und das Marketing der Dienstleister \u00fcbernehmen und das \"zusammen\" machen. So wollen wir verschiedene Dienstleister in Marketing-Kampagnen von ServiceAtHome integrieren und z.B. mit den Dienstleistern auf Social Media auftreten oder Plakatwerbung betreiben."

This is the technological heart of the Starship Jacket, allowing optimal management of the heat naturally produced by human body. In fact, the Graphene Plus membrane creates a thermally conductive path that allows heat to move from the hottest to the coldest points, thus homogenizing the temperature inside the garment. When the membrane is coupled to an insulating fabric, the G+ membrane absorbs body heat and re-radiates it towards the user, generating greater insulation and increasing the temperature of the microclimate inside the garment, while maintaining the characteristic of breathability. Our Graphene Plus membrane overperforms every traditional technological sportwear ensuring a dynamic interaction with the body and adapting the temperature to the evolution of the user thermal profile.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Internal fabric: a smooth, luxury-feeling white lining. We took the highest attention to all aspects of the Starship Jacket; in fact, all internal stitching has been welded together with special orange tapes. This recalls the Graphene Plus logo and further increases thermal isolation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere do I choose my size and give my delivery address?\u00a0 A couple of days/weeks (depending on your reward level) after the campaign is finished, we will send you a survey where you\u2019ll need to choose your size and input your desired delivery address.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

As water is scarce you have to shower as quick as possible. \u00a0And even by shortening the timespan of this beloved luxury, you will run out of water as your crew also has to wash the salt out of their hair and skin. It's always a limiting factor.\nFor us and our sailor friends it always saddened us when, we had to leave a beautiful sunset in a bay to sail to a crammed, expensive Marina, just because we've run out of fresh water.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, our idea was:\u00a0\nLet's start to improve the largest water consumer unit on a boat.\u00a0\nAnd this is your shower.\nWhat if we could multiply the amount of \u00a0water on our boat? Maybe by up to 10x ?\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can reach this goal by adjusting the way your shower works!\nOur concept states:\nIf we don't want to dumb precious water in the sea we need to close the water cycle in your boat. This will be done with our system.\nFinally, this concept will give us way more options in terms of flexibility and sailing destinations.\nSo we developed the AquaX10 .\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour solution to multiply the amount of clean and fresh water on your boat.\u00a0\nWith the AquaX10 you extend the freedom of your sailing trips. \u00a0\nNo longer will you have to leave a bay or that magic spot where you want to stay.\u00a0\nMultiply your fresh water and be free.\u00a0\nThis is our take on sustainable sailing.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWe offer an environmentally-friendly product which recycles sweet water that would otherwise be pumped into the sea and therefore be lost to the salt water.\nThe AquaX10 is our contribution to saving precious sweet water whilst sailing.\u00a0\nGiving you the freedom of having a big topic off\u00a0your To-Do list.\u00a0\nHow to get fresh and clean water.\u00a0\nThe AquaX10 takes care of that for you.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a long time electricity and water have been the major resources that limited our sailing experience. In the last years, the electricity issue has been widely solved with solar panels and wind generators.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we will solve the last limiting factor on your boat.\u00a0\nWater!\n\n\n\n\n\nBacking this campaign and supporting the AquaX10 will give you the opportunity to contribute to a better personal sailing experience and a cleaner environment.\u00a0\nUsing our advanced filtration techniques will give you fresh and pure water on your boat for an entire trip. And the best is yet to come.\u00a0\n\nPrototypes of the AquaX10 are already installed on sailing boats.\nNow we're in the process of testing, improving and adjusting them on our sailing boat and the boats of our families and friends.\u00a0This means, we're going through the final R&D process.\u00a0 Our system produces fresh water and the Prototype is working as planned. If we achieve our funding goal on Kickstarter, we can start to develop this system into a \u00a0smarter and automatized version for you. We will develop a system that is more comfortable and includes an easy to use Touch-Display System.\nWe'll finish the process of testing and adjusting the Prototypes, finetuning \u00a0of the filters and development of our controller in the end of winter 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur confidence in the projected timeline is strong, With your backing, we'll be on track to start shipping products to backers during Q2/2022.\u00a0We are\u00a0excited to see Kickstarter backers with our AquaX10 in harbours around the world soon!\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the AquaX10 we focus on the water cycle e.g. in the shower of your boat. We make sure that every drop of water is used. \u00a0The setup provides you with a specialized system which includes active coal filtration techniques to clean your water to the size of 0,01 \u00b5m.\u00a0\nThis is even smaller than the size of bacteria or, in times of COVID, the size of a virus spore.\u00a0\u00a0\nOur system and its single components are designed and optimized for boats.\nWe tested many setups considering major factors of the marine environment like energy, water flow, internal pressure, outside temperature, humidity and many more.\nThis iteration process brought us to the setup we're now using in the AquaX10.\nAll the substances in your waste water have to go through multiple filtration and cleaning sequences in the AquaX10.\u00a0\nThe waste water will be filtered and the clean result goes back to your fresh water tank. Through this internal cycle, we make sure that the system will be clean and you get\u00a0up to 10 x the amount of water from your tank.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the integration of the AquaX10 you create a water circuit within your boat which will provide fresh water for you and your Crew. Wherever you are. Whenever you want. The filters can clean up to 10.000 litres of sweet water before they have to be changed. You can be sure to have clean water on your boat that can be used to shower, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst things first: Our shipping guarantee to you\nWe've already negotiated resources for production facilities and we work with an experienced partner from the industry.\u00a0\nAs we've mentioned above:\u00a0\nWe'll finish the process of testing and adjusting the Prototypes, fine tuning of the filters and development of our controller in the end of winter 2021.\u00a0\nWith your support we'll be able start the production of the AquaX10 systems.\n\nThe revolutionary size and positioning of the AquaX10 system\nWe all know one thing for sure.\nSize matters.\nEspecially on a boat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Ca. zum Gewicht und den Abmessungen schreiben\n\nThe AquaX10 system is designed in accordance with the space limitations on sailing yachts.

In order to stop further outbreaks and save lives, testing must continue for the foreseeable future. And experts recommend COVID-19 testing becomes routine.\u00a0\n\n\u201cAs more contagious coronavirus variants emerge and lockdown measures are relaxed, the nation needs to intensify, not scale back, nationwide testing efforts.\u201d - Dr Jennifer B.

There are a few problems with this:\n\nYou may be away from home, at work, or just sitting on the couch and don't want to fire up your computer for what should be a simple task. We're not always near our computers, or we may not own a computer.\nMobile browsers aren't user-friendly for this type of task\nFinding an available COVID-19 test and booking it takes time. You have to search for an available test, search for a test that is close to you, and then there are forms to fill in.\nOverall, it's currently a complicated, stressful, and time-consuming task\n\n\n*If you are uninsured, it is also significantly more complicated to locate and book a COVID-19 test, because some healthcare providers will not allow patients to book without insurance*\n\nTest In Your City is the first free mobile app of its kind dedicated to finding and booking a COVID-19 test. \n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Connected to a nationwide database of every Hospital, Urgent Care, Community Health Center, Pharmacy, and COVID-19 testing site, Test In Your City will let users easily find and book an available COVID-19 test based on criteria that are important to them: convenience, location, test availability, waiting time for results, and other criteria.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My goal is to make the future of COVID-19 testing as accessible and simple as possible, for everyone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(App prototype.

Mounting holes (1/4-20) let you mount auxiliary hardware, such as an action camera (not included) for teleoperation or inspections tasks.\nA Lidar Sensor Array allows QBii to locate itself in its environment in order to improve path following performance. These sensors also enable advanced capabilities like Simultaneous Location and Mapping (SLAM).\nThe Expansion Port (including third motor controller) and Lidar Sensor Array are part of the Expansion Kit add-on.\n\nControl App\n\n\n\nControl App on Smartphones and Tablets\n\n\n\n\n\nApp Screens\n\n\nOverview\nTo operate QBii, you will use the QRS Control App, which runs on smartphones and tablets (not included). The Control App allows you to run QBii in teleoperation mode ('joystick' mode) or in autonomous mode ('path following'). You can use the built-in Path Editor to create and run customized paths.\n\nNo lines on the floor! No embedded cables! QBii can operate autonomously without any infrastructure changes to your home or workplace.\n\nCurrent Functionality\nThe current functionality of the Control App and how it relates to QBii's various capabilities is illustrated in the series of videos below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessing the App: The App can be installed on a smartphone or tablet.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnecting to the Robot: The App and robot interact using a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) client/server protocol.

Joystick Mode lets you operate the robot directly in any of these configurations. To illustrate this point, this video shows Joystick while in 'cart' configuration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating a Path: The most powerful feature of the Control App is that it lets you create, save, and run robot paths. Using the Path Editor, these paths are built up as a series of from simple segments (e.g., \"Drive\", \"Turn\"). You can name and save your paths to be reused later. In this video we create a simple path called \"Zig\" to illustrate the process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning a Path: Using its Path Running ('Map') screen, the Control App provides a graphical representation of a saved path. You can then \"press play\" and have the robot run this path. The App shows you a real-time update of the robot's actual position as it executes the path. \u00a0This video shows the robot running the simple 'Zig' path.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing a Path to Carry a Bin: As with Joystick Mode, Path Following Mode is independent of how the robot is configured. To illustrate this point, this video shows how the simple 'Zig' path we created in an earlier video can be used to direct QBii to deliver a bin to a specific location. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing a Path to Clean the Floor: In this example we've equipped QBii with a floor sweeper. We then ran the 'Zig' test path to show how reusable paths can be used for any purpose, including cleaning the floor. In an actual application, more complex floor sweeping patterns can be constructed. Different patterns can be used for different parts of your house or building. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing a Path to Tow A Cart: In this final example we've attached QBii to a cart. Again, the 'Zig' test path is used to show how a robotic cart can be sent on a specific route from A to B. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nPlanned Improvements to the Control App\nThe functionality of the Control App (Rev 2), as shown in our project videos above, exists and has been tested. However, we are in the process of making improvements.\u00a0\nPlans for Rev 3 include the following:\n\n\u00a0Platform Migration: Completion of migration to a multi-platform App in React Native. Rev 2 represents the mid-way point of this migration. Rev 2 has been tested on Android smartphones and tablets. Rev 3 is planned to operate equally well under iOS as well.\n\u00a0Refinements: Refinements to existing screens and functions.\n\u00a0Localization using Lidar Sensors: We demonstrated the ability to read a sensor array consisting of three fixed-point (non-rotating) lidar sensors, in order to get range measurements between the robot and its surroundings (e.g., walls, fixtures). We have also demonstrated the ability to use this data to localize the robot, i.e., update its running estimate of where it is in the world. We have used this to generate a point-cloud map of the robot's surroundings. This is a precursor to Simultaneous Mapping and Localization (SLAM). However, these demonstrations currently exist as stand-alone pieces of code that are not yet integrated into the Control App. Plans for Rev 3 call for adding the code into the main Control App, thereby providing support for lidar sensors and localization.\u00a0\n\u00a0Simplified Path Following: We are working towards a simplified One-Click Destination capability, which will allow you to specify a destination, letting the App will do the rest.\u00a0\n\nOur goal is to have Rev 3 of the Control App coincide with delivery of Rev 3 QBii units as part of this campaign.\n\nWho Can Benefit from QBii?\n\n\n\nUsers who can benefit from QBii\n\n\nSince QBii is uniquely multi-functional, it is ideal for both home or work, and is a versatile tool for educators and hobbyists alike.\n\nQBii Robot Kit\nTo offer you the best possible value, we are providing the option of selecting the QBii Robot Kit as your pledge reward. \u00a0The Kit includes all the components needed for a complete, fully functional QBii robot, which you can assemble yourself. The Kit comes together using simple hand tools and no soldering is required.\u00a0\n\nThis option is ideal for hobbyists, DIYers, STEM educators/students, or anyone who enjoys hands-on projects.\n\nBut don't worry. If assembly isn't your thing, we'll do it for you (see Assembly Add-on).\u00a0\n\n*Important note* Battery charger AC plug is compatible with North American electrical outlets. Adapters for non-North American outlets are not included.\n\n\n\nQBii Robot Kit\n\n\nSupport for STEM Education with Kit Donations\nMost of our junior engineers and developers have participated on high school robotics teams. Our founder, Dr. Frank Naccarato, was also a robotics mentor for many years. We have benefitted from STEM-based curriculum. This campaign is an opportunity to give back. That's why we've added a reward tier that allows backers to contribute towards our donation of QBii Robot Kits to schools.\u00a0For every 10 backers at this level, we will build a Kit for the express purpose of donating it to an academic institution.\n\n\n\nPledges will allow QRS to donate QBii Robot Kits in support of STEM Education\n\n\nReward Tiers & Add-Ons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQRS's stylish and extremely sought-after keychain\n\n\nDevelopment Roadmap\nFor the past year and a half, we have designed, fabricated and tested two prior generations of prototypes: Rev 1 (proof-of-concept) and Rev 2 (fully functional).\u00a0\nIn fact, all the photos and videos you see here are of Rev 2 prototypes.\nA successful campaign will allow us to reach the following development milestones:\n\nUpdate of the Rev 3 design to incorporate the lessons learned from Rev 2\nAdd important refinements to the Control App and onboard embedded software\nRefine the Expansion Kit\n\n\nAbout Quantum Robotic Systems (QRS)\nTasks involving lifting, pushing and carrying (e.g., lifting laundry, carrying groceries, cleaning the floor) are often challenging, especially for seniors and people with limited mobility. On stairs, performing these tasks becomes laborious at best and dangerous at worst, potentially leading to serious injury (falls, back strain, etc.).\nQuantum Robotic Systems Inc. (QRS) is a Toronto-based company that addresses this problem by making unique mobile autonomous robots. QRS has developed and patented a novel stair-climbing technology that allows users to carry heavy, bulky loads up and down stairs in an easier, faster and safer way. The company has incorporated this technology into its Robotic Stairclimbing Assistant (ROSA), a service robot that can carry things while climbing up and down stairs.\u00a0\nQRS was founded by Dr. Frank Naccarato. Frank is an inventor, entrepreneur, consultant and professor with over 30 years\u2019 experience in R&D and product development. After completing his doctorate in robotics at the University of Toronto\u2019s Institute for Aerospace Studies, Dr. Naccarato worked as a research engineer, designer, project manager and director of R&D. His past projects include a control algorithm developed for the International Space Station and a robotic testing machine for medical laboratories.\u00a0\n\n\n\nFrank Naccarato, Ph.D., P.Eng., founder and president of Quantum Robotic Systems\n\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\nOne of the toughest challenges for a small technology start-up is finding a way to get early products out there, into the hands of real users, in a cost-feasible way.\u00a0\nA successful campaign for QBii will give QRS just that opportunity.\u00a0\nKickstarter will allow us to realize our production ready design (Rev 3) and introduce it to the world on a large scale.\nWe will also be able to demonstrate early market traction, which will allow us to leverage the sales realized through Kickstarter into further outside investment and additional government support for R&D.\nWe will also be able to start negotiating volume rates for parts and materials, which will bring our manufacturing costs down.\nSo, your support will have a major impact on our future success.\u00a0\nIt's a big deal!\u00a0\nThank you!"

        "Text": "Due to the pandemic, many couples, friends and relatives have had to separate from each other. So I came up with an idea to build something to alleviate this situation. And I call this the \"Magic Message Box\", which should simply receive a text message and present it on an OLED display after you open its lid.\u00a0\nYeah, it practically does a simple function that even the oldest cellphone could do. But it is a small box with an attractive appearance and because it's a box, you may keep some tiny meaningful things in it. You may stick an old photo to the inner side of the lid to remind you of who sends you this box or the precious moments of your life.\nThe message sender could be anyone who knows the serial no. of the box and is able to use the internet. Actually the sender would usually be the one who gives the receiver this box as a gift.\u00a0\n\nIt can be a gift sent to your grandparents, who may not know how to use a smartphone but always have your photo safely kept in an album.\nIt can be a gift sent to your lover, who loves all kinds of expressions of romance.\nIt can be a gift sent to your kids, who like toys and like playing different magical games with you all the time.\nIt can be a gift sent to your close friend who you always have little secrets to share with.\n\nAfter all these thoughts floated in my head, I started to draft the sketch and all its relevant components.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThen I started to buy things. I was thinking, there might be some existing attractive boxes being sold in the market and I didn't have to design a new one which would consume unnecessary resources and wouldn't be environmentally friendly. So I purchased the box, display, power module, Wi-Fi module...everything online.\nUpon receipt of those components, I started working on the programming of the website and the control module respectively.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, I started to build the prototype.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, fortunately, it worked!\nI would like to share this prototype with everyone, so I decided to launch this project on Kickstarter, and hopefully, with the support from you guys, I would be able to commercialise this product. And I definitely know, from prototype to mass production, there is still a long way to go.\nAnd I also want to improve the design by adding other functions & modules.\nLastly, it would be much appreciated that Magic Message Box could be on your list when you are considering sending a gift to someone you care about most.\nYou may also scan the QR code or click on the link to take a glance at the website:\u00a0\nhttps://qrgo.page.link/KMGsb \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe videos below illustrate how to upload a message to Magic Message Box.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

An Analog Morphing Core equipped device, like the RIDGE, controls the nonlinear elements of the clipping stage (traditionally diodes) by changing in real time their threshold, making them behave like a new kind of diode.\nIt allows musicians to have access to a virtually infinite number of clipping options: symmetric, asymmetric, high headroom, very compressed, etc. in a single analog circuit, controlled by the unique Mood knob. Completely different from approaches such as modeling and switches between different diodes.\nThe result is an extremely versatile and unique analog circuit.\u00a0\nAnalog, Augmented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an animated gif. Give it time to load.\n\n\nUse the mood knob to select from the ultimate clean boost to a fully compressed overdriven sound. Ever dreamed of a heavily distorted sound, that would still react to your playing?\nSymmetric, asymmetric, high headroom, compressed \u2026 you decide.\nA never-ending journey through overdrive sound flavors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose between ultimate transparency at any grit level with the three EQ knobs at noon, or colour your sound using the powerful EQ section.\nChange the way the pedal reacts to your guitar with the PRE knob, how it interacts with your amp with the POST knob, how you cut through or blend in the mix with the MID knob.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nPunish the front end of your amp like never before thanks to the 30V maximum output voltage of the RIDGE and experience extreme dynamics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some samples of how the RIDGE sounds. Just to make you wait until you get yours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect the RIDGE to your expression pedal and explore new possibilities.\u00a0\nAdjust drive level, boost your mids, or blend two completely different tones together. The possibilities are endless.\n\n\n\nThis is an animated gif. Give it time to load. Illustrative purposes only : knobs don\u2019t physically move, only settings do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RIDGE features an internal preset that can be used without the need to use an external device, accessible via the Preset footswitch. Rhythm and lead tone, clean and dirty, or any other combination: you have access to two sounds at any time. Simply hold the Preset footswitch for 2 seconds and save the current position of the knobs for later use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RIDGE is entirely MIDI compatible. You can plug an external MIDI switcher to the RIDGE via mini jack to save and recall up to 128 different presets and cover all your overdrive needs.\u00a0\nYou can also connect the RIDGE to a third party controller (like the incredible Erae Touch from our friends at EMBODME) and change in real time its internal parameters to explore new ways to interact with overdrive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use all your instruments with The RIDGE: guitar, but also bass, synths and vocals. This is made possible thanks to the pedal\u2019s adaptive input gain. You can choose between instrument level or line level at any time to use the RIDGE on all your tracks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe showed the RIDGE to professional musicians. Here is what they had to say about it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Want endless overdrive flavours from an analog circuit?

        "Text": "\nIntroduction\n\nHi, my name is Kehinde Fasehun and I am a junior and Entrepreneurship and Innovation major at Clarkson University where I am working on a project called Platform. Platform is a freemium service aimed at being a creative and collaborative social networking application aimed at connecting individuals with projects and ideas to individuals that have the skill/monetary-based resources needed to make those projects and ideas a reality. It's a centralized virtual space for project collaborators (ex.\u00a0 Artists, Designers, creators, and Visionaries). It's almost like Kickstarter as well, except people cannot only support projects financially, but they can also contribute to them with their skills.\n\nIn a sense, Platform is a mix of Reddit's communal section, Instagram's interesting content, Tinder's matchmaking algorithm, and LinkedIn's job recruitment section; combined in hopes of creating a relaxed or perhaps creative community for people to diffuse and collaborate on projects big and small.\n\nOur team is comprised of 4 co-founders, 3 of which are recent Clarkson University graduates and one undergraduate. We started Platform because of a common issue all 4 of us faced from prior projects. The issue of finding project collaborators. Because of that shared issue we faced, we quickly realized that in a broader sense, other people also shared similar pains in finding people with shared interests who are passionate enough to join them on the adventure of creative collaboration.\n\n\nRevenue Generation\n\nUpon the completion of the first iteration of our mobile app, we intend on generating revenues through access fees. access fees will be charged to Patent Attorneys, Studios, \u00a0Engineers and etc. These firms and occupations will be charged an access fee to provide their services to collaborators on Platform.\n\nWhy service fees?\n\u00a0So let's say a user has an idea for a book then connects with another user to write the book. What will they need? A publisher. So publishers could pay to have access to Platform collaborators who may need their services. \u00a0Patent attorneys and a variety of other people who will need access to Platform users. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRoad Map\n\nMy team and I have been working on Platform for the past 2 years, but due to a variety of factors such as being underskilled and lacking access to financial resources we simply have no option other than to turn to the Kickstarter community for financial aid. We are currently looking to raise $262,780 in funding to kickstart our development and deployment of Platform for the duration of a year. Below is a list of our projected expenses:\n\n\nDevelopment and Maintenance (Continual) : $150,000\nmarketing (Continual): $50,000\nWeb hosting (Continual): 5,000\nLegal and professional fees: $5,000\nRewards shipping: $5,000\nKickstarter fee: $13,140\nPayment and Processing fee:$13,140\nMargin of error: $21, 500\n\n\n\n\nUpon reaching our funding goal, we will be hiring two full-stack developers within two weeks of reaching our goal. \u00a0Upon the success of our beta test, depending on how many users and connections are made on Platform, we'll start reaching out to Venture Capital firms for more funding to scale up development, marketing, and formally become a legal entity.\n\nWe intend on giving out T-shirts with the Platform logo on them as a reward for your donations."

Built for quality, comfort, and satisfying key presses, the SK3 is the world\u2019s most compact wireless mechanical keyboard and laptop companion. It can be placed directly onto the keyboard of any laptop under 14.9 inches without interacting with the original keyboard, increasing speed and accuracy, saving desk space, and keeping your screen closer to you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIts 65% layout makes allows you to position your hands more naturally with less movement, and with bluetooth, 2.4G, and wired connectivity, it can be connected to a maximum of 5 different devices at the same time. Switch between devices with a single key press for a more efficient multi-device workflow. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nSK3s also include high-quality Gateron hot-swappable switches, so you can customize whether you hear a click, how smooth your key presses are, and how much force needs to be applied to activate a key.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 65% the size of a typical keyboard with 68 of the most common keys, the SK3 has minimized size while maximizing functionality. Where other laptop-compatible mechanical keyboards require desk placement, remove touch pad functionality, or insert the wrong characters at the slightest shift, SIKAKEYB SK3 fully enhances your current typing experience, so there\u2019s no need to compromise.\nIn addition to maintaining touch pad functionality, the SK3 allows the area beside the touch pad to be used as a wrist rest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SIKAKEYB SK3\u2019s main body is made from durable yet lightweight aluminum that has gone through CNC machining and a careful anode oxidation process. With its translucent black ABS bottom, out of the box, the SK3 is an instant classic, merging that fun, retro feel with elegant, clear-cut design choices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSK3 has wired and wireless modes that allow you to connect with up to five devices at the same time and switch between them with the press of a key. At full capacity, it can interface with \u00a0(1) Type-C device, \u00a0(3) Bluetooth devices, and \u00a0(1) 2.4G device.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Type-C wired connection\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWireless connectivity. Connect to one 2.4G and three bluetooth 5.0 devices. Use FN+Q/W /E to bluetooth 5.0 devices\uff0cFN+R to 2.4G devices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSK3\u00a0is compatible with Mac, Windows, iOS, and Android system, so you can switch between your phones, laptops, and tablets. When using a Mac and Windows device, press FN+A/S to switch between modes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0SK3\u2019s compact design takes up 65% of the space of a traditional keyboard and includes the 68 most common keys.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSK3 uses Gateron hot-swappable switches and plate-mounted stabilizers so you can DIY a typing experience you\u2019ll love.\n\nTyping sound of silver switches\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SK3 is compatible with most switches on the market, including plate-mounted and PCB. Mix and match. The possibilities are endless.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default plate-mounted style costar stabilizer offers a great touch experience right out of the box, and creates minimal noise so your typing won\u2019t be intrusive. Replacement with a screw-in stabilizer is simple and straightforward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSK3\u2019s double-color keycap design is both sleek and functional. Your fingers will sit comfortably on each keycap as you type, and the cherry height sitting will allow you to transition smoothly from key to key without accidental touches. This was achieved via a special over-molding technique using PBT material.\n\n\n\nKeycap shape of SK3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 5 Gateron switches available with your SK3 include the Blue PRO,Brown PRO, Silver PRO, Yellow PRO\u00a0and White PRO.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrive DIY Keyboard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0The SK3 comes with 3 default configuration settings, but allows you to customize your keys any way you like using your computer. You can also use the quick-switch function (FN+Z/FN+X/FN+C) to switch between the different configurations and maintain your optimal workflow at all times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the best features of mechanical keyboards is their customization, and each SK3 offers full-color RGB background lighting to fit your aesthetic.

So far, the general LCD 3D printers on the market do not support large format requirements and usually sacrifice quality and precision to save costs. This is why we spent years developing prototypes and testing them until we came up with a tested and perfect final success formula: CyFantasy3D CY-OS01 is a light-curing LCD 3D printer for large format projects. Provides industrial precision and high-end smart functions at unprecedented speeds.\nPrinting Videos(Keep Updated)\n#1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not just the speed, large format printing or the industrial precision performance. Those are definitely features that make the CyFantasy LCD 3D Printer unique. However, we\u2019ve gone beyond that, adding five intelligent functions to a 3D Printer like no other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the box of materials of the CyFantasy LCD 3D printer is running short of whichever material you\u2019re using (it supports common resin, strong toughness resin and elastic resin, among other possible materials), the printer will automatically detect this shortage and it will also automatically refill it. What does this mean to you? You\u2019ll save time and, more importantly, the consistency of the printing process and the integrity of the printing results are not affected by a sudden interruption and a disruptive refilling process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoving the box of materials from a 3D printer to replace them is so old school. With the CyFantasy LCD 3D Printer\u2019s world's first flash material replacement program, you can literally replace the material you\u2019re using with a single click on the operation panel. Yes, really!\n\n\n\n\n\n3D printing should be a clean and precise process, leading to a pristine result. However, most 3D printers are not stable enough to do that\u2014but the CyFantasy LCD 3D Printer is! The connecting rod of the printer's forming platform adopts an exclusive ball screw design that provides a steady printing experience, dramatically reducing vibration while printing, and extraordinarily improving the quality and detail of printed objects.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0It looks like a scene from a futuristic science fiction movie, but it is actually another user-centric feature of this excellent printer. The cover of the CyFantasy LCD 3D printer is flipped in a smart way, with no need to manually open and close, so you can enjoy it more easily, and at the same time feel that you are using cutting-edge technology from the future to help your creative projects come to life!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical features and functions make CyFantasy LCD 3D printers very smart and efficient. However, we also believe that the printer you use should be outstanding and amazing in every respect, which is very important. Therefore, unlike the typical and rigid rectangular box structure of ordinary 3D printers, we designed the printer as a high-end cyberpunk helmet. The point is: no matter how you look at it, there is no 3D printer like CyFantasy LCD 3D printer!\n\n\n\n\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to run a large manufacturing operation to enjoy industrial-grade precision. In our view, that\u2019s not a luxury\u2014it\u2019s a requirement that any 3D printer should have. That\u2019s why we tested the CyFantasy LCD 3D Printer for three months in dental clinics. We had to create a superb printer that could deliver superb results. We can now proudly say that the surface smoothness of what you create with our printer comfortably meets industrial-grade standards that can cater to different business needs.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, the LCD light-curing printer platform is also extremely sturdy and compact, offering industrial-grade durability and reliability, strengthening the printer\u2019s capacity to meet the requirements you have for your creative project of business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCyFantasy LCD 3D printer allows you to monitor and modify the printing process during the printing process: from the printing time to the remaining time, you can view the data displayed on the screen at any time, and you can change to adjust the items. Real-time display through the operation panel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve spent a few years looking into the challenges of 3D printing until we came to our presently successful formula. We no longer see extremely high prices for printers and consumables, and we\u2019ve been seeing FDM technology and SLA machines and consumables becoming increasingly accessible and affordable. Still, we knew that low-cost technologies such as the new LCD sacrificed accuracy and size to generate savings for the buyer. That was not satisfactory, so we decided to develop a large-size, high-precision, low-price LCD 3D printer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt sounded great, but we hit a technical wall when we realized that 3D printing LCD moulding technology is extremely layered, namely when the moulding area becomes larger. The bond with the bottom layer is so strong that, when we separate layer by layer, model separation is problematic and may even lead to model deformation. This explains why there are so many LCD machines on the market\u2014but none in the large-size field. We decided to solve this problem by running a lot of tests until we finally got our CyFantasy LCD 3D Printer. It now includes intelligent functions such as one-key automatic flip, one-key refuelling, and automatic feeding, and it\u2019s tried and tested to deliver spectacular large-format results, even being in the LCD camp. In other words, problem solved! Now we need your support to manufacture this large-size industrial-grade precision 3D printer!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 2,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $900M raised between them.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

You will not see any cookies notifications.\nBut does it mean that the cookies are \u2018gone\u2019 or that your privacy is in danger?\n\nNo, it does not.\n\nThe software will do all the most annoying job for you!\nThe application will accept or deny the processing of the cookies,\u00a0depending on the chosen settings/preferences.\nThe application does this by giving users the possibility to independently choose cookie settings, to compile them and then to make them known to websites, applications, and other digital services in a fully automated way.\n\nTired of reading cookie - policies?\n\nCurrently, the Internet users must indicate their will separately for each website or application, usually in the form of reading and accepting (or not) abysmal cookie-policies.\n\nThis makes web browsing less convenient, as those policies vary, and are written in a complex language. The lack of time or desire to read the cookie settings makes them often being unseen.\n\nThe current situation limits the freedom of movement, freedom of choice, affects exercising the active right to the protection of personal data and puts people in a dependent position.\n\nWith the Sovernty - cookies manager there will be:\n\n\u2713\u00a0 Lack of the long cookie policies\n\u2713\u00a0 Leaving the software to read them\n\u2713\u00a0 Lack of complicated, hard to understand terms\n\u2713 No more fear of being a product without a permission\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can be so much easier\nInterested HOW? See the video below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo more being a product ?\n\nThe titans like Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, or Microsoft are unstoppable.\nTheir profits are surging.\n\nThanks to the processing of more and more data, the Internet user has become not only a consumer, but also a product.\n\nBy employing more and more new technologies, but also clever tricks, users are sacrificing their privacy without getting much in return.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe legal regulations introduced by the European Union, such as ePrivacy, or the GDPR, are intended to limit this practice, giving users more rights.\n\nThese regulations, however, do not contain simple, ready-to-use tools.\nWithout appropriate applications, despite extensive protection enshrined in legislation, we are not able to enforce our rights. This is putting us on an equal footing with companies that are making profits by using our data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo balance this position, it is necessary to introduce solutions that will easily help the Internet user gain control over what data he is going to transfer and to whom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5,000 - Basic version of cookies manager scheduled on time within 6 months after the successful campaign\u00a0\n10,000 \u2013 Improving and caring for the product with ongoing marketing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGratis download to all Kickstarter Backers.\u00a0\n\nHELP US \u2013 We need your help!\n\u00a0So we can help internet users regain control over their cookies and data.\n\n\n\n\n\n- Please, donate.\n- Don\u2019t want to donate? It would be great if you could share this page!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are a start-up, located in Amsterdam, that develops activities in the field of flexibilization, facilitation, and optimization of transparency, partly for more efficient market forces, as well as the development, stimulation, and provision of online tools and services.\n\nThe team consist of members with different experience and has an international character, connecting people from different backgrounds.\n\nA part of the tasks is done by students from a variety of disciplines (such as legal, marketing, or science) which makes it possible to collaborate and exchange ideas between people with different interests and expertise.\n\nOur mission is to make the internet safer, and more accessible to everyone.\nOur main goal is to give the internet user more control."

Well, we need to raise capital to complete and launch our web application. Fanimie is a new, fun, and creative platform for creators, influencers, celebrities, and fans to interact. On this platform, creators will be able to earn money through fans' subscriptions, set at their price. The creators will also be able to share exclusive content, sell merch, host competitions, play games, sell video calls and cameos. In other words, we have everything in one place!\nWhy do we need funding?\n-- We are in the process of designing the web application and we also need to build the platform as well and that costs. We have been able to pay graphic designers but we need funding to hire someone to build the platform, for marketing purposes and other costs to cover and complete the platform before launching.\nWe appreciate each and everyone of you who considers or donates to fulfill our dream to launch a new fun and interactive web application. Thank you for considering to help us.\n/Emmelina & Vivien"

Turn on the camera, test microphone, volume up the speaker and blah blah blah\u2026That\u2019s too much work. We want to make virtual meetings as easy as ABC. So, we have Unear A30 here. It is an all-in-one device that covers all functions of the camera, mic and speakers.\n\n\u00a0Smart, Fast, and Efficient\nThe foundation for the ideal meeting.\u00a0\nWith the most advanced AI technology in the capture and analysis of sound, Unear A30 aims to make its professional debut by providing the best acoustic experience. That notwithstanding, it enhances image performance and clarity through specialized features. Unear A30 is easy-to-use and compatible with online meeting platforms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWide-Ranging Applications\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to meetings, Unear A30 can greatly improve video conferencing quality under different scenarios.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnear A30 is safe and user-friendly. With Unear A30 you can say goodbye to freezing or choppy video calls. A direct USB connection focuses on mitigating unstable signals.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy is our top priority with Unear A30. A simple and secure Plug-and-Play connection via USB with no third-party data processor removes a point of weakness for potential security threats.\n\n\n\n\n\nForget about constantly shifting the camera to keep everyone in the room in frame. With an ultra-wide angle camera, Unear A30 makes it easy to host a meeting with multiple people in the same room. Each of the two Unear models feature ultra-wide viewing angles. Unear A30T, which is in pearl white, is equipped with a 100\u00ba ultra-wide-angle camera, while the more advanced Unear A30 is equipped with a 115\u00ba. Each ensures that everyone is captured by the Unear A30 / A30T panoramic view during the meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a 4-element omnidirectional microphone array, no details are missed.\nScanning for all voices in a 5-meter range, Unear A30 is able to detect and pick up the details that matter most in a meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\n360\u00b0 wideband speaker ensures clear and precise human voice output. This full-range speaker will ensure that the speaker is heard well, and the meeting can move along smoothly.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmbedded in Unear A30 is an enhanced AI, making it possible to intelligently process sound by suppressing common environmental noises in a meeting such as air conditioning and typing clatter.\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert echo cancellation can be necessary in large meeting spaces. With higher echo return loss enhancement (ERLE), Unear A30 minimizes these common meeting interruptions that can waste time and participant\u2019s mental energy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProviding a headache-free experience, Unear A30 is compatible with most mainstream online meeting platforms such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, Skype and others. Unear A30 supports mainstream operating systems like Windows, Mac OS and Linux without the need for an adaptor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnear A30 utilizes a 4MP high-definition camera. Equipped with a suite of image corrective functions, Unear A30 ensure users have a great online meeting experience.\n\nSelf-adaptive toning\nLens distortion correction\nAnti-flickering\nAutomatic exposure\nWhite balance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstant mute, camera on/off toggle, and volume adjustment can all be achieved by Unear A30\u2019s sophisticatedly designed touch panel, saving you time to effectively manage online conversations and video calls.\n\n\n\n\n\nEasy to understand colored lights on the circular status indicator on the top of the Unear A30 provide clear indications of device status.\n\nYellow light: Device is powering on\nRed light: Microphones are muted\nOrange light: Camera is turned off\nBlue light: Normal Unear A30 operation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnear A30 supports full-duplex communication mode, which allows for more natural simultaneous communication with others. The comfort afforded by this allows for more communication efficiency that boost productivity in bidirectional communication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Unear A30 is narrow at the top and wide at the bottom. It is tip over resistant by design with its rubber base. The elegant black and pearl white bodies of Unear A30 and A30T are coated to make them fingerprint and stain resistant as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Uniarch\nUniarch is a sub-brand of Uniview, the company that commits itself to video monitoring research and development, bearing the mission of making smart life easier through reliable video technology, one-stop smart products and friendly services for the customers.

I find annoying the process of going to a physical store to buy whatever I need, sadly delivery hasn\u2019t changed or improved in the last couple of years, outside of the united states getting a package delivered can take up from a couple of weeks to months, and let's not even talk about the ridiculous fees than cant rack up to 200% of what you are trying to buy, When I lived in Bolivia I became frustrated because every time I wanted to buy my favorites item from platforms like amazon I realized that the price of the delivery surpassed the price of the product, which is ridiculous. So I did a little research and found out that these companies had a monopoly on the global market, and they didn\u2019t give a real price to their customers. So inspired by business models like those from Airbnb and Uber I thought of a solution for international deliveries. It took me many days of researching models and many hypotheses so that my idea could work, and I came to realize that a model of the shared and collaborative economy in the world of international deliveries was the perfect one. Having that information I began the real work of trying to put everything together. I began designing the app, trying to think of all the functionalities that it could have and everything that took to make the idea of Trudego a great tool for travelers of the world. This process took me about 2 months which I spent programming what would be the start of the platform. Then I started validating my idea, asking my relatives and friends if they would like to receive their packages way faster and cheaper, they even told me they would buy much more if something like this existed, so 16 years old me decided to go and make this project a reality, 2 years later I\u2019m launching this crowdfunding campaign to show everybody that a model like Airbnb or Uber can be applied to international deliveries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrudego is a platform that aims to become a community of people that want their products to be delivered in hours rather than weeks or months, meanwhile, we also want to become a way for people to make money out of their travels.\nThe concept is quite simple. Do you want to make money while traveling? have some free space in your luggage? use Trudego and make some money without doing much. We live in a world where people are constantly searching for ways to generate income, and many times our community will prefer to give money to an individual rather than a company, thus creating a sharing economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe soul of the project is much deeper than the objective, and it\u2019s split in half, The first from the traveler's side. The concept is that by taking a couple of other people's packages you can pay for a good part of your trip. the more you deliver the more money you earn, that way we want to make sure that many Trudego fans would be able to travel the world for free. In the second part, we side with the buyer. A person who is in some part of the world and who is buying a product online from another part of the world, it doesn\u2019t even have to be something you bought, it could be a gift from your grandma, that she wanted to arrive on a certain date and international shipping couldn\u2019t deliver. The idea is that the moment you make your purchase you can connect with a traveler who is in the city of purchase and who has a destination to your city, thus achieving something no intercontinental shipping can do at a decent price, getting your package in under 5 days.\nTo summarize, our sole objective is to build a community that loves using Trudego and uses it to finance their journeys through the world. On the other hand, we got people a control panel Trudego to get their products worldwide, becoming one of the fastest shipping methods. The more people use it, the more we can change the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNowadays the market of international deliveries has become lazy, and companies like Trudego could move the foundations of the current market, sending a wake-up call to these companies that lost their ambition for innovation, and disrupting their ridiculous business practices.\nThe fact that people could win money traveling is utopic and sounds fake, but with Trudego, something as simple as taking a package with you to the airport could become an opportunity to make money, is a concept that allows people to enjoy traveling more often, and with better quality of trips. One of our greatest innovations is the fact that we are going to create a tool designed for the consumer. In other words, the main problem that we solve is not that people need new sources of income, since that is only a consequence of our creation. The main problem is the time it takes to get the package and the security of that package. At Trudego we are really about your experience and wish that Trudego is your number 1 option when it comes to delivery.\nI am not looking for Trudego to be a small platform that competes at a minuscule level in the market. But on the contrary, a very interesting alternative to traditional shipping options.\nThe platform has two types of functions: Trudego integrates into \u00a0Ecommerce and the sending of packages from person to person.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's put ourselves in the place of a customer, the customer enters an online store and buys the products, then the store itself tells the customer that they use Trudego, then if the store doesn\u2019t cover the delivery, the client pays for it through the store, and the store pays Trudego, from a customer's point of view they will only make 1 payment when the total to pay is shown, and the store will make the arrangement with Trudego, the same applies when the store offers free shipping.\nThe client then receives a mail from Trudego that notifies him that our platform will manage the delivery, and the mail will tell the client the approximate day and time the package will be delivered, according to the store and the traveler that will be making the delivery; Once that\u2019s done they will receive a link with the current status of the package and the route of said package. Then the agreed day the traveler will arrive at the door of the buyer with the packages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe traveler must register, filling in some important questions that will be shown to anyone on the platform, this information will help us notify the traveler of packages from stores or people, \u00a0that the traveler might like to deliver, the information of each package will be shown, information like the weight or dimensions of each package, the exact pick-up location and any photos there are; if everything is correct the traveler will make an offer and negotiate the fee and the time it will take to deliver the traveler could work with a suggested fee or they can negotiate the fee themselves. assuring the traveler that he/she can benefit from their travels. Trudego\u2019s commission will be 15%.\nIf the offer is accepted, a customer\u2019s communication tab will open where the traveler and the store/ person will be able to communicate better and arrange the details of the pick-up. This communication is optional because stores can give the information beforehand to expedite the shipping process. Once everything is sorted the traveler picks up the package and travels to the destination, the day it is arranged the package will be delivered and the status of the package will be updated.\nTo ensure the safety of the package and its safe delivery the traveler must leave a warranty and make a 2-step verification, The first step is that the travelers have some money as a warranty, and in case of the package not being delivered Trudego will cover all the damages, the next safety step is, in case the package is of high value the traveler must give and extra monetary warranty, all the money will be returned to the traveler when the package is delivered, thus giving the customer and the store and extra layer of protection against any problem, even in cases of fortuitous events, the company will cover any damage through insurance.\nThe travelers will also have many tools at their disposal like maps and information about the packages that will help them plan their journeys. Something important to emphasize is that Trudego won\u2019t cap the number of packages a traveler can deliver, \u00a0as long as all the safety regulations are met with their airline of preference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s imagine that we want a package delivered from Barcelona to Miami, said package is a laptop that we sold through our eCommerce website, and at the moment of the purchase the customer added the shipping address, automatically a petition is generated to deliver the package, the petition is then sent to every traveler with a scheduled trip from Barcelona to Miami, a suggested price will generate automatically, and the only thing that changes is who will deliver the package, then the travelers will try to negotiate the conditions of the delivery. Trudego also offers an automatic mode that can be set according to our preferences, maybe we want the cheapest delivery, maybe we want the fastest or the traveler with the best score available, once that\u2019s done a chat will open, giving us direct communication between us and the traveler, there we can coordinate everything, to the date and time of the pickup to more specific details that might make a better experience.\nThe advantage Trudego offers is that if you need an express delivery you could contact someone that travels the next day, making an intercontinental delivery in just 2 days!\nThe store could choose to only work with Trudego or offer Trudego and other traditional shipping companies. The store will have a control panel showing every order, payment, pending travelers, delivery offers, and many more tools at their disposal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo maybe two people want to use Trudego? let\u2019s assign them, person A and person B.\nPerson A wants to send a package from California to Paris, Person A enters Trudego and makes a new offer detailing everything about the package, this way an order is placed the many travelers available can interact with a said offer, then Person A chooses which traveler wants to work with; then Person A decides if they want to pay for the delivery or Person B could be in charge of paying, then the traveler picks the package up and, everything is set in motion, and every aspect of the process is identical to the rest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this image we can observe our catalog, this function is for the stores that want to manage their products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this image we can observe the order's management tab, here we can see the status of each of our deliveries\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this image, we can observe the Collaborator\u2019s tab, where a store can manage all the travelers that will deliver the packages.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the chat, where customers collaborate, and stores can have direct contact if needed ensuring the safety of the process\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the payment tab. This tool is provided by trudego. It allows stores and people to keep tab on how much money they are investing in deliveries.\n\n\nTiers:\n- Raise your hand!

Since I was a little kid I was interested in all things about business. I was involved in the business. I used to put a price on things that most kids would not even consider, for example, I didn't sell you candy, in school, I sold you the thrill of eating candy in class and laughing with your friend from the little mischief.\nThe way I was, wasn't formed naturally, it was due to the way that I was raised, many things that I considered unfair, like helping my family business while the other kids played. are the things that made me who I am today.\nI know I'm the right person to make this project a reality. I have the experience and the passion to do everything that's in my power to make Trudego successful entrepreneurship. I've funded Nepus, a crowdfunding advisory agency. Nepus gave me the experience I needed and made me come into contact with experienced people that have given me a lot of knowledge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Despite not meeting our target funding goal, we were overwhelmed with the support from our original pledgers! Thank you!\nWe wanted to show our appreciation by giving a 10% discount to be used in our Store for all previous supporters that re-pledge, if the campaign is successfully funded. This will last for a full month and can be redeemed by signing up to our Portal. Don't worry, we'll let you know when you can do that!\nWhen you boil it down, \u00a0we're just a bunch of enthusiastic nerdy guys, working long hours in a converted dentistry lab, in the southwest of England. We're trying our absolute hardest to make the IoT a place that allows anyone with an idea, no matter how big, to make a go of it and hit the ground running! Your trust in us and your generous pledges will give us the chance to make that a reality :)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe're all mostly excited to see your creations and wonderful ideas, spawned from the ability to implement IoT into your project, overnight. So get that imagination flowing and read on...\nIf you're not familiar with Pebl, you may want to skip to the \"What is a Pebl?\" section!\n\n\nDuring our time away, we've been busy.\nWe were being asked left, right and center if we'd be offering the Pebl for sale on our website despite not meeting our goal. Unfortunately, the answer was no as we just couldn't afford to do so :(\nHowever, immediately after our last Kickstarter campaign, we managed to secure funding which enabled us to further develop the Pebl product and supporting infrastructure to a point where it is now firing on all cylinders and waiting to be used by you!\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter learning so much from the last campaign, this time around, we're going to try our hardest to provide more information about HOW the Pebl can be used to enable your products to become part of the IoT!\nScroll down, take a look and please get in touch if you have any questions!\n\n\nSo what has been improved or changed?\nWith the feedback we've received over the last couple of years, we have been able to improve and develop our offering further, and we now believe it is far better than before and overall, a more complete and well rounded solution.\n\n\nPebl Hardware\n\nThe Pebl hardware has been completely redesigned to cater for new features, better reliability and higher performance.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have redesigned the power management system to allow for a wider range of input voltages whilst consuming lower power and generating less heat. We have also optimised the WiFi antenna location to provide a longer range and better performance. A fully featured UART serial bus was squeezed in for even more flexibility. The RGB led control now has more stability, allowing improved visual performance by fixing a known flickering issue.\n\n\n\u00a0Pebl Evaluation Board\n\nAn exciting new addition for our pledgers is an easy to use and handy Evaluation Board for the Pebl, so straight out of the box, you can get to grips with the way that it works and what it's capable of!\n\n\n\n\n\nFind out more information below and take a look at our Virtual Pebl Evaluation Board to get a taster of how it works!\n\n\n\u00a0Portal Development\u00a0\n\nWe have worked extremely hard to build the user front end to the point where it is now useable for everyday management and control of all your devices. This was something that was not readily available before, but is now raring to go!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe're really pleased with it and hope you get an opportunity to use it! We have built in multi tenancy for our commercial users and a full account management system, which is further explained, later on.\n\n\n\u00a0API Implementation\u00a0\n\nWe're most proud of this achievement, being the backbone of device control and usage. The final outcome is awesome! The newly reworked API allows for no fuss usage, with no tiresome hoops to jump through, no manufacturer lockdowns and best of all, it's completely documented! All this whilst of course being fully authenticated.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fingoti back end has full multi tenancy support allowing users to not only create multiple organisations for their devices but also for a partner/tenant relationship with customers.\u00a0More about that later...\u00a0\n\n\nWhat is a Pebl?\nAt Fingoti we are striving to provide a simple, out-of-the-box gateway solution to the Internet of Things (IoT). We wanted all the research and development to be done for you and encapsulated it in a smart, secure, flexible and reliable package as standard.\nAnd so the Pebl was born.\nPebl can connect with and control electrical equipment, from making sure the kettle is boiled for that first cup of coffee in the morning, to collecting analytics to track production efficiency for your business. The possibilities are endless.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe IoT is a place where everyday physical items are quickly becoming part of the virtual world that is the internet. These items can be controlled and monitored from a distance to, for example, improve your life at home, increase productivity in the workplace or improve performance and reliability in industrial equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe IoT is already a very big and daunting place, especially if you are just starting out. Trying to manufacture and provide an IoT solution can be an expensive and drawn out process, requiring technical and specialist expertise. We believe it should be intuitive and simple, so we've done all the hard work for you. Our product can be used by everyone and anyone. Pebl provides an end-to-end solution for enthusiasts, business owners, education, home automation projects and... well, anything!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pebl is a standalone IoT device that requires no assembly and no programming. \u00a0Following a simple two minute setup procedure, your Pebl is ready to be incorporated into your project providing IoT functionality that will bridge the gap between the virtual and physical world, from and to anywhere in the world!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe really are providing the complete IoT solution. \u00a0We offer the hardware, software and back-end infrastructure, \u00a0supporting all that you will ever want to do. All you have to do is provide the power of imagination!\n\n\nAnd what can I use the Pebl for?\nNow that we've looked at what the Pebl is and how it works, now let us explain what it can be used for and why we think it's such an incredible little tool that unlocks so much potential...\nThe Pebl is designed to be used as a component within custom hardware. You can think of it as a secure IoT bolt-on for your existing and exciting new projects. You can simply implement the Pebl into your project or solution by modifying existing or creating new circuitry to meet the demand of your application.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe believe that by implementing the Pebl into your existing or new development project or product, you will see fast and large returns. This is due to the lack of upfront setup costs, as we provide the entire solution.\nPreventative maintenance, remote monitoring and assistance, data processing and management packages are all contracts that you can provide to your customers, at the price of a single device, the size of a sugar cube!\n\n\n\n\n\nPebl is designed to remove any requirement for central control hubs, is completely self-reliant and requires almost no technical knowledge to set up. Simply download our app, enter your WiFi credentials and that's it. You are connected to the IoT and ready to begin making your own ripples in the internet.\nEvery Pebl can be set-up wirelessly, using our USB Adapter or pre-configured at time of manufacture. Once the Pebl is configured, you can let your imagination run wild and build the next big thing, streamline your factory, teach your STEM pupils or monitor your heating from work.\n\nSo why use a Pebl and not an Arduino or Raspberry Pi instead?\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst and foremost, security. The Pebl, unlike other similar devices on the market, comes with enterprise grade security as standard.\nAdditionally, the Pebl is pre-programmed. \u00a0One of the challenges with the Arduino, Raspberry Pi and similar devices, is creating the code you need to achieve your application's goal. More often than not, this rarely proves easy or reliable. The Pebl simply responds to predetermined commands.\nFurthermore, as the Pebl is a fully encapsulated device, you don't have to worry about electrostatic discharge (ESD) or moisture damage as you would with bare board devices like the Arduino and Raspberry Pi. The watertight housing provides a barrier for use in almost any scenario, protecting against harsh environments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFour GPIO pins and a data bus for communication with I\u00b2C and UART sensors and accessories is made available. This allows makers to produce and market their own IoT peripherals that the Pebl can simply plug into. The Pebl device can be used for multiple applications by easily removing and reinserting into another product.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor enthusiasts and inventors, we provide a breadboard breakout adaptor, \u00a0to enable you to easily implement a Pebl into your projects for quick\u00a0and easy development and testing.\nWe are offering a wide range of rewards that\u00a0we hope will spark your imagination and get your ideas flowing!\n\n\nOkay, but how do I talk to the Pebl?\nGood question. I suppose it's not much use just sitting there looking pretty!\nThe Pebl will accept, execute and respond to a predetermined set of commands from various methods of communication. There's something for everyone here and regardless of the method you choose, \u00a0the requests and responses are identical.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease visit the Developer section of our website to learn more about and try out the Pebl commands for yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight, but where can I use the Pebl?\nWe designed the Pebl to be as flexible and versatile as possible so that it could be used in most environments...\n\nIndustry\n\n\n\n\n\nHobbyist\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\n\n\nDomestic\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurity\n\n\n\n\n\nMarine\n\n\n\n\n\nMedical\n\n\n\n\n\nAgriculture\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSay hello to the Fingoti Portal, finally!\nThe Fingoti Portal is a secure place to manage, monitor, control and interacts with your and your customer's Pebl devices.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pebl can be used with or without our\u00a0Portal. The vast majority of customers will use the Portal for its convenience and ease of use. However, the Pebl can be used in many other different ways, which of course, are free of charge, as explained previously.\nWe've designed the Portal to cater for everyone from enthusiasts to small business owners and even large commercial applications. We have implemented our own infrastructure on the Microsoft Azure platform, resulting in a user experience that is intuitive, concise and rewarding.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you decide to use the Portal, we charge for the use of communications called 'Ripples'. A single Ripple is a full device request and response cycle. Ripple usage is either based on a pay-as-you-go or subscription basis.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll get 1,000 free Ripples with every new account, but if you require more for your application, then you can choose to pay from just \u00a31.00 for 5,000 additional Ripples. This essentially means you can query your device every 10 mins for an entire month, for just the price of a cheeseburger!\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using our API as a commercial customer or as a third\u00a0party developer, the charge is issued in the same manner, however, high usage of the Portal can result in a cheaper monthly contract if desired.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur payment terms are completely transparent and you can pay for as much or as little as you want to use, with or without a subscription.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom our Portal, users can claim devices using just the serial number. Once the Pebl is linked to an account, the owner can monitor activity, manage settings and connect with other Pebl devices, including virtual devices.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe back end infrastructure is centred around an organisation. Users can be members of multiple organisations by either creating a new one or being invited to an existing one, through a very simple email invitation process. \u00a0\nEvery organisation has its own set of roles that can be assigned to a user, in order to grant access to certain areas. Either make use of the system roles provided or create custom roles.\nYour devices are then claimed by the organisation. That way, users can be added and removed without affecting the use of any device. All of this can be easily managed on our Portal or via the API.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also apply to become a partner which gives you the ability to create organisations as tenants. This allows you to set up organisations for your customers whilst maintaining the ability to manage everything for them, from their devices to their subscriptions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease take a look at our Usage Calculator above to get a clear idea of our pricing, should you wish to use the Portal.\n\n\nUsing our super new Pebl Evaluation Board\nWe're really excited about this :)\nWe hope that you'll support us and pledge for one of these boards, as they are an excellent way to discover and explore the Pebl's capabilities and how it can easily be implemented into your application. Your pledges will also fund further Portal development and help to boost our product's market introduction.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Evaluation Board allows you to try out all the following features:\n\nPush buttons to trigger events\nShine a large LED torch\u00a0\nSpin a vibration motor\u00a0\nSnap a 250VAC 10A relay for switching mains devices\nSound a buzzer\u00a0\nRead the temperature and humidity\u00a0\nCheck the light levels\u00a0\nStore data in an EEPROM flash memory chip\nSend and receive UART data via USB\nConnect your own prototypes to an external header\nProvide an external power supply\n\nTake a look for yourself...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr, if you'd rather have a play, check out the Virtual Evaluation Board we put together!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ideal on-boarding tool\nNow it's even easier to set up your Pebl! You can simply use the USB Adapter to connect the Pebl to your laptop or computer and send the commands to get your credentials loaded onto the Pebl.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot only that, but the USB Adapter can be used for testing and debugging, with built in GPIO indicators for easy trouble shooting. In addition to being able to send requests and receive responses, you can also stream raw serial data across the internet using the UART bus mode!\n\n\nTell me more about the Pebl's awesome features!\nWow! If you've got this far, you must be keen (or just really nerdy?!)\nThere is a lot of exciting stuff packed into such a small little gadget. Here are few amazing things that the Pebl is capable of, with a bit more detail to explain...\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pebl's onboard 160MHz 32-bit processor is used in conjunction with a WiFi engine as its primary network connection method. The WiFi connection has a range of up to 50 metres.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2.4GHz WiFi engine uses the standard 802.11 b/g/n protocol and provides an extremely reliable connection to a router or access point. WiFi connections are WPA, WPA2 and WEP compatible as standard and incorporate a variety of TKIP and AES encryption, as required.\nIn simple terms, the Pebl's WiFi provides secure, powerful and reliable performance, resulting in a lightning fast response to user requests.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe biggest risk for IoT devices is the lack of security. The Pebl provides peace of mind where this is concerned. Its WiFi is fully capable of end-to-end encryption when using our Fingoti Portal.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use Microsoft's Azure platform to provide a robust and proven method of transmitting data over the internet, securely. Using a SHA256 encrypted SAS key, communication to the Portal from the device is protected while in transit and at rest by Microsoft's firewalled servers.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the IoT world requiring clever, reliable and varied sources of power, we didn't want to limit the device to a particular voltage. \u00a0Instead, we've made the Pebl tolerant to a wide range of voltage inputs. This allows you to power the Pebl with a USB output, solar panel or even a car battery, just to name a few.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a built in voltage pump, the Pebl will operate on a wide input voltage range of anywhere between 3v and 16v. The onboard voltage smoothing ensures that the GPIO outputs aren't electrically noisy and provide a steady 5v output regardless of the input voltage. The voltage regulation does generate a small amount of heat, but this is properly dissipated, with efficient built-in heat sinking.\nSimply, the Pebl can be used with many different power sources, allowing a wide range of applications.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 4 user-configurable GPIO pins on the Pebl act as inputs or outputs as required in your application. They each provide an output of 5v with up to 25mA of current which is more than enough to power logic, LEDs or relays, amongst other things.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese GPIO pins can detect a change in GPIO state every second, instantly reporting back the information to the user.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pebl acts like a secure, remote middleman in serial communication, simply passing bytes onward via the bus and handling incoming data to be relayed back to the user. Making use of the serial bus, allows users to communicate with external processors and modules in two different ways...\n\n\nFirstly, as an I\u00b2C master:\n\nUsing the Pebl's serial bus as a master for high-speed I\u00b2C data bus applications, serving over 100 slave modules is an extremely useful feature. The data bus is 5v tolerant and incorporates the necessary pull-up resistors.\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u00b2C is a globally recognised communications protocol that uses just two wires for data transfer. This allows for a vast range of sensors and devices, such as an RTC (real time clock) above, to be monitored, read and written to, from anywhere in the world.\nThere is an abundance of I\u00b2C modules and devices on the internet at extremely low prices, that are very well documented for easy implementation.\n\n\nSecondly, as a UART serial port:\n\nThe Pebl's serial bus can also be configured to be used as a fully featured UART serial bus for your application. This is useful for applications that require external communications to GPRS or GMS modules.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UART serial mode allows the user to send and receive serial data instantaneously! All standard serial communication settings are exposed, for example, baudrate, parity and flow control, for use with many different UART applications.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pebl includes a 16 million colour RGB LED that can be changed to any colour using a single command, visually communicating with users for many different purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe device also incorporates a 'blink' feature that allows you to adjust the flashing speed, duration and colour. This provides additional flexibility and uses for the Pebl device.\nPretty cool, eh?\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to use the Pebl outdoors? No problem. \u00a0The device is immune to dust, dirt, rain, moisture and extreme weather.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pebl is designed to be IP67 rated, \u00a0which certifies that it's waterproof and we're working on getting this officially assessed as soon as possible after our campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk the Pebl to do the heavy lifting for you to perform tasks automatically. Set a timer to read the temperature every hour, or turn a heater on at 5:00pm ready for when you get home from work, using the scheduler!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay, okay, we know it doesn't have a battery, \u00a0but believe it or not, that was a conscious decision. A battery limits you to use devices and peripherals that are low powered which can limit your IoT application - not what we want to see!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe believe that for an IoT device to be truly reliable and ensure that its data reporting is as accurate as can be, then it should be continuously powered. We have an environmental responsibility to provide the best performance we can, so, we made the Pebl as power efficient as possible. It consumes approximately 350mW on average.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsn't it irritating when new software gets released and you have to individually update every device you have? Not with the Pebl, it's actively checking for updates.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe release software updates after passing an extensive customer acceptance testing process, so we're confident they won't interrupt your IoT application and cause any hiccups. You can opt for scheduled automatic updates when they are available or if your application is mission critical, update manually via the Fingoti Portal at a time that suits you.\nIf your Pebl is connected to our Portal, you'll never miss an update, forever.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the Pebl via the Fingoti Portal is easy and seamless. The Pebl can connect itself to our Portal (if you wish)\u00a0which allows you to access, \u00a0monitor, change and update it using our friendly Portal user interface.\nBut, don't worry, that's not the only way to use your Pebl...\nThe ways in which the Pebl can communicate with the outside world are extensive.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor those budding entrepreneur and/or nerds amongst you who are looking for a more commercial, industrial or custom solution or you'd consider yourself an advanced user then the Pebl will respond to other methods of communication.\n\n\u00a0MQTT - Connect to a custom broker\n\u00a0HTTP - Issue local POST requests\n\u00a0WS - Stream responses through a websocket\n\u00a0UART - Onboard UART for serial communication\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur API can also be utilised for direct communication, securely, via our Portal, but implementing your own user interface and back-end. This solution can be useful for third-party developers and custom applications that require high security and minimal fuss/cost setup.\nPlease take a look at our API Reference Documentation and Device Commands\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, we get that a lot, it really is that small!\nRequirements for the size of the Pebl were defined early on to be as 'small as possible' but remaining 'beautifully tactile' - not an easy one.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was important that the Pebl was both minimal and self-contained. \u00a0This compares to the IoT hardware that is currently available, often being bare-board with exposed electrical components. Every cubic millimetre of the device has been utilised. All components are internal and self-contained with a chemical and water resistant resin, which acts as a heat sink as well as protection from environmental factors.\n\n\nWhat rewards can you get your hands on?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe're friendly so please get in touch!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Please note on the final version the LED strips will be hidden, the glass bottom will be removed and perfectly round, LED strips will be brighter, and the speaker drivers will be tuned. Additionally, the ferrofluid animation and coding are still being optimized.\nThis is basically our rough draft speaker and as RND continues the Eclipse speaker on release will be refined and perfected. \u00a0We are still sourcing materials and parts to guarantee the Eclipse speaker has incredible build quality.\n\n\n\n\n\nSixty-one years ago, NASA engineers created the first magnetic fluid called the ferrofluid. This invention made it the world's first truly magnetic liquid. Inspired by this feat, we formed a team and created the Eclipse speaker. The Eclipse is a first-of-its-kind speaker that uses a ferrofluid and an electromagnet to create a stunning audio visualizer.\nFor ferrofluid to even be visible in a glass bottle, just like traditional ferrofluid containers, the glass has to be specially treated to prevent staining.\u00a0The manufacturing process for a ferrofluid bottle can be time-consuming and costly to ensure the glass is properly treated.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0How does it work?\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nYour device > audio analyzer > electromagnet > ferrofluid movement\nThe Eclipse speaker works by taking audio transmitted from your device and converting that audio into digital signals. Those signals are then sent to the electromagnet where it pulses those signals as magnetic forces. The magnetic forces meet the ferrofluid causing a magnetic reaction and thus the ferrofluid movement.\nWe've fine-tuned and refined our firmware through countless hours of testing and coding all in a pursuit to add features to prevent dead spaces, obtain the best visuals possible, and regulate the electromagnet's sensitivity.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nUtilizing the ferrofluids magnetic property the Eclipse\u2019s audio is enhanced with our Fluid Mass Bass boost system.\nFluid Mass Bass Boost takes advantage of the mass of the ferromagnetic fluid by exactly matching the speaker output phasing to the movement of the fluid.\nThis results in a physical alteration to the center of mass of the speaker cabinet and allows for a more solid and realistic bass sound than would typically be achieved with a speaker of this size and specification.\ntl;dr the ferrofluid makes the bass sound good.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Key features\nCapacitive touch controls: At the top of the Eclipse is our control module for the speaker. Flat and touch-sensitive controls similar to a touch screen to control volume, Bluetooth, pause, and many more features.\nLED lighting: Inside the Eclipse's main chamber is LED lighting for the ferrofluid bottle. The LED is RGB+W allowing you to display just about any color imaginable including pure white. LED is controllable via our smartphone app included with your purchase.\nElectromagnet: Inside the Eclipse is a 500N electromagnet synced with the audio analyzer chip. Music sent to the Eclipse is converted into electromagnetic pulses rhythmically moving the ferrofluid.\nRemovable panel: On the bottom of the Eclipse is a removable panel for swapping out ferrofluid bottles. We plan on offering additional ferrofluid colors in identical glass bottles you can switch into your eclipse.\nBluetooth: No wires needed the Eclipse is 100% Bluetooth allowing you to play your music wirelessly.\nFluid Mass Bass Boost: Upgrade your bass with the power of ferrofluid. Our custom-designed system utilizes ferrofluid unlike any other speaker to create a sensational bass quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaker Colorway stretch goals: With a variety of colorways; you can choose a speaker that is truly yours.\nFront panel customization: The ellipse also has a removable front panel creating opportunities for different colors and possible artists collaborations for the most personal product possible.\nColored ferrofluid stretch goal: By achieving the colored ferrofluid stretch goal we can deliver a fairly wide range of colored fluid for greater product personalization.\nStyle is personal and the Eclipse speaker was created with the purpose to give users a better way to express themselves and create memorable experiences. Our mission is to make the Eclipse's customization seemingly endless leaving nearly nothing to be unattainable.\u00a0\nApp features\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nLighting settings: Adjust your LED lighting with full-spectrum controls to change the color and brightness. \u00a0Plus, there are tons of color-changing lighting modes for you to choose from.\nGenre selector: Optimize ferrofluid animation by matching your music with a genre. Our presets are custom made to enhance ferrofluid animation for the specific genre.\nSound equalizer: Customize your audio to your liking with our built-in sound equalizer. Take control of your settings and fine-tune your audio down to the finest details.\u00a0\nAnimation presets: Experiment with your ferrofluid's movement with our animation presets. Preset animation modes that change how your music is translated to ferrofluid movement.\u00a0\nFerrofluid control: Control your ferrofluid with no audio required from the power of your smart device. In-app controls for you to activate the electromagnet and move the ferrofluid.\n\u2026And plenty of bonus features!\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Capacitive touch controls\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nLocated at the top of the Eclipse speaker is the capacitive touch control panel. Capacitive controls are like touchscreens where you don't have to click a button to use a feature. Simply tap the icons and you can use any of the features on the panel.\u00a0\nFeatures currently include volume up, volume down, Bluetooth, and power on/off.\nThe capacitive controls are easy to use without having to worry about analog buttons breaking down or getting stuck.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe didn't just stop at making a ferrofluid visualizing speaker, we made sure it sounds phenomenal too.\nWith a max volume output of 86db, the eclipse can get as loud as a lawnmower (90db) or a vacuum (80db) at peak volume.\n\u00a0With dual premium speaker drivers tuned to perfection, an acoustically engineered casing, and our custom Fluid Mass Bass Boost system,\u00a0we can promise you the audio quality is out of this world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesigning a ferrofluid speaker isn't really something that has been done before. Unlike conventional speakers, we have numerous extra bells and whistles that need to fit inside. Not only do we have an electromagnet on the inside but speakers drivers are naturally magnetic. Forcing us to get creative and keep the ferrofluid from being drawn in by the drivers.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoding the firmware for the speaker was the next obstacle to overcome. Translating audio to magnetic pulses was another obstacle in the pursuit of perfection building this beautiful machine. We were able to generate code that synchronized pulses whenever audio hit a certain volume threshold. Then we had to refine our code to adjust for pauses in music and varying levels of volume. We didn't stop there and continued coding to make sure any song could be visualized perfectly.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code listens to and samples the music many times per second and isolates peaks in the audio at different frequencies. Then, using a self-optimizing logic, it decides which frequencies will then trigger the electromagnet.\nIn a nutshell, our code sets a threshold for each frequency band from the audio playing. These thresholds automatically adjust and modify pulses for the audio being played. Once a threshold is broken that triggers a pulse from the electromagnet. The hold time for the pulse is determined by the audio playing. \u00a0Hold time is the length of the magnetic pulse or how long the magnet is actively holding the ferrofluid.\nThe settings are also adjustable and customizable inside of the Apollo Eclipse app.\nAfter tons of testing and prototyping, we finally settled on a design that met our strict standards of quality and runs effortlessly.\n\n\n\n\n\nPower type: Wired (Due to the electromagnet power requirements this is NOT a portable speaker)\nWeight: TBD (We are still finalizing inside components)\n# of speakers: 2x speaker drivers\nConnectivity Tech: Bluetooth\u00a0& WIFI\u00a0\nElectromagnet strength: 500N\u00a0\nFront panel material: Acoustic fabric \u00a0\nControls: Capacitive touch controls\u00a0\nLEDs: RGB+W LED strips with Bluetooth connectivity for control via Apollo app \u00a0(all spectrum colors and full white)\nFerrofluid bottle: 250ml anti-stain solution and 20ml ferrofluid\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince its inception, a combined amount of well over 2,000+ man-hours have been put into this project. Our team has been responsible for designing, prototyping, engineering, sourcing, and funding the project.\u00a0\nThis isn't our first rodeo in the eCommerce and product development space. Our small executive has a track record of developing eCommerce brands into 7-figure giants in as little as a year. Our proven strategies for digital marketing, product dev, social media, and customer support enable us to turn customers into super fans. \u00a0With over $3,000,000 in revenue and over 200,000,000+ organic social media views to show.\nWe've found it's much easier to sell to existing customers so our secret sauce is to create the best possible customer experience. \u00a0Fast and accurate shipping times with quality so good you rarely need customer support. We don't need any business secrets to scale just simple customer satisfaction.\nThe Eclipse is more than just a Kickstarter for us; we're looking to turn this into a community of Apollo fanatics. We've learned a lot from developing the Eclipse and have tons of ideas stored in the bank for our product roadmap. \u00a0We can promise you there are even bigger projects to come from the Apollo team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0As well as biweekly updates we will additionally be making frequent posts on our social media platforms to keep our community updated. Posts will include prototype photos, manufacturing updates, concepts, and tons of other content.\u00a0\nAdditionally, our team of customer support agents will be replying to comments and questions on Kickstarter and social media. As well as updating our FAQ page and Kickstarter with relevant information regarding the Eclipse.\nWe're committed to staying transparent with our process and allowing customers to be informed about their products. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Pledges may vary (these are the items included in the 1st tier pledge)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

If I fall down, it is extremely difficult and frustrating to get up again, not to mention embarrassing. I love the adventure of cutting my own trails. I look forward to seeing this thing happen. You have my whole support.\" --Casey\n\"Balance isn't my strong suit. Last winter a little patch of ice took me down and I pulled two hamstrings. Something like your SkiAvec would have spared me a lot of pain and six weeks of physical therapy.\" --Tom\n\"We went skiing a couple weeks ago.

I could see that Nordic ski areas might keep some rentals for novice skiers.\" --Dawn\n\"The idea of having a machine make the trail is great...It has been years since I did any cross-country skiing. I like the idea of having a route laid out. I just remember that managing the poles was feat enough for me.\" --Danette\n\"Do you want a cardiovascular workout in fresh winter air away from the crowds? Then the SkiAvec is the perfect tool for creating new trails, using low-impact and quiet e-bike technology! I'm a XC skier who loves to find remote unpopulated natural areas, and this will provide more opportunities for me and my family to enjoy back country skiing adventures!\" --Lisa\n\nThe next steps\n\nFunding. Our next step is to manufacture and test three prototypes in the Pacific Northwest. Why three? Because more testers of varying abilities in different regions will provide a wider array of actionable data points to ensure that the SkiAvec will perform in a variety of winter conditions, such as snow textures, temperatures and terrain. Our request for $28,850 will cover the cost of producing the prototypes, including a mechanical engineer's labor, design and drawings, plus hardware, fabrication, assembly and testing.\nA Vision for SkiAvec. Following development and testing, we will be revising our design plans to incorporate feedback, and then move into production of a retail model for individuals, ski resorts, etc. Our goal is to offer a simple-to-use, affordable machine that instills confidence in our customers' ability to pursue cross-country skiing in new and continued ways.\nThank You!

Sometimes 5 is too much, sometimes 2 is not enough.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter making the first prototypes, I found it so cool and useful, that I decided to make a version that could be controlled by pressing buttons instead of pedals.\nSo open\u00b7control was born.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u279c SOFTWARE DESIGN :\nAfter designing the hardware, I had to choose which actions each control should perform. But again, \u00a0it was hard to decide which functions would benefit the majority of users. \u00a0So I decided to let the user decide what's best for him as easily as possible.\n\nRight now open\u00b7control is optimized for Ableton Live, with its own Script and Editor.\nBut being Open Source, it could evolve and encompass software like Logic, Bitwig, who knows ?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBright LED Matrix display\n\nmin. 6 Buttons / Switch pedal inputs\u00a0\n6 RGB LEDs for visual feedback\n\nmin. 2 Endless Knobs / Expression Pedal inputs\n\nMIDI In and Out ports\nStandard USB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0open\u00b7control is available in 3 formats\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pocket version has 6 Buttons with visual feedback and 2 Endless Knobs with Push buttons, bringing it to a total of 8 buttons. It comes in the most simple yet elegant form of a printed circuit. It is the perfect companion to your mouse and keyboard to control Live and provides easy shortcuts to your favorite actions.\u00a0\nA 3D printed cover is available if you want to protect it.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith its 8 Jack inputs, the Boxed version allows to plug up to 6 Foot Switches and 2 Expression Pedals. But if you only need half, that's not a problem, you will still enjoy its bright display and solid built.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0If none of the models above suit you, and you have the skills for it, you can always build your own enclosure. The Maker version has all the features of its brothers (6 buttons with visual feedback, 2 \"sliders\" and 2 endless encoders with push buttons), it is up to you to imagine the best box for your own use.\n\n\n\n\n\nopen\u00b7control is fully customizable through an easy to use Web interface (also available offline).\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can decide what each button will perform (long and short press), and what the \u00a0LEDs and main Display will show.\n\nHere is a list of some of the actions already available (the list will grow with User Requests) :\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0You can also use the buttons to do \"standard\" MIDI mapping.\u00a0\n\nHere are a few examples of possible set ups :\n\n\n\nDisplaying Scene names\n\n\n\n\n\nSet up examples\n\n\n\nYou can find more details on the open\u00b7control website opencontrol.me, or see the Web editor for yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, open\u00b7control, like its predecessor, is capable of controlling Live's Looper, except that it is now much easier:\n\nno more Max For Live: open\u00b7control doesn't rely on Max For Live anymore, the Script takes care of everything\nin order for a Looper to be detected, just add (LOOPER#) to the name of the Looper device, or simply press a button on your controller.\nyou can monitor up to 6 Loopers simultaneously on the 6 LEDs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Watch a little demo of open\u00b7control :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to make it ready for the stage, and not be limited to the USB cable length, open\u00b7control has mini-jack MIDI In and Out ports. The USB cable will then only be used to provide power to the unit.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0open\u00b7control can also be controled by your favorite Pedal or Pad controller (for instance Behringer's FCB1010, Roland's SPD-SX, KMI's Softstep,...).\u00a0\nIf you have a controller with MIDI Out that can send temporary CC or Note messages, just plug it in and let open\u00b7control know which Note/CC to listen to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA 3D-printed cover is available for the Pocket version.\nIt was designed by Bruno Tognin and is made out of recycled plastic bottles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Display:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Bright 6x32 LED Matrix\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 6 RGB LEDs\u00a0\nboth have adjustable brightness\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Inputs / Outputs:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 6 Switches (Buttons or Pedals)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 2 Sliders (Knobs or Faders)\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Mini-Jack \u00a0MIDI In and Out \u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 USB\n\nopen\u00b7control is based on a Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040) chip. \u00a0It is programmed in C/C++ using Arduino, but can be programmed in CircuitPython / MicroPython.\nEach of the components (LEDs, buttons, matrix, Analog Inputs) can be accessed through the I/O pins.\n\n\n\n\n\nopen\u00b7control already has a long story, at least in the lab...\nWatch it evolve from a Teensy-based \"State Of The Loop Mk2\" to a fully original and integrated device.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe box itself has mutated from the first prototype of \"KBD Multifootswitch\" to the final enclosure.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also be part of this story by supporting open\u00b7control !"

        "Text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith online ordering and deliveries increasingly common, people may lack proper space near their front door to receive a delivery. Items may be placed in a disorganized manner near a front door and be at risk for blowing away due to inclement weather, being stolen, and the like. Placing items on the ground leaves the item at risk for dirt, debris, insect infestations, etc. which can be especially unfortunate when it comes to food deliveries.\nFreshLedge is delivery shelf system capable of being placed near a front door or window on a home, office, or other building. The system is comprised of a shelf with a hinged mechanism near its rear edge used to firmly secure the shelf to the building exterior. The hinge allows the shelf to be placed in a vertical position for storage when not in use and a horizontal, deployed position when a package is ready to be received.\nDelivery personnel can pull down the shelf when he or she is delivering a box or other package to a building. The shelf accommodates the item(s) and keeps them elevated, safe from dirt, debris, insects, etc. There can be extensions or attachments to support different sizes of items ranging from boxes, beverage containers, food containers, and more. Optional smart home features could also be integrated in which the shelf can automatically deploy to a specific length when a package delivery is nearby.\nThe system can be constructed using metal, plastic, and other suitable materials. The shelf and other components may feature custom colors or designs to accommodate all user needs and preferences. Exact size, measurement, construction, and design specifications may vary upon further development and manufacturing. I currently hold a provisional patent on \"FreshLedge\" and will obtain a non-provisional patent by early next year.\n\n\n\n\nHere is my current prototype at my home. I made it out of wood, hinges, magnets and chains. We use ours by noting it in the comment section of our deliveries.\u00a0\nFor example:\u00a0\nWe order fresh baked cookies to take to work sometimes and they deliver them fresh as soon as 8am in the morning. When we place the order the night before on the app, we note in the comments, \"Please do not place on floor, please pull down FreshLedge on wall by front door and place there, thank you.\"\nWhat has happened in the past is, \u00a0they place the box on the floor and leave (contactless delivery) and we don't notice the \"delivered\" notification on the app, since we are either in the shower or getting ready. By the time we notice, even if it's just a few minutes after, a trail of ants has made its way into the box and you know the rest lol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0The future of \u00a0FreshLedge could be very cool, ESPECIALLY when it becomes a SmartLedge and can be something that could be a touchscreen/camera/doorbell/ledge all in one. Pretty much your own concierge, it even holds your bags.\u00a0\n\nThank you for taking the time to read about my idea, have an amazing life and continue to be great!"

I couldn't find what I needed in any commercial product (and I've tried them all). What I did find was a great community that feels the same way. A community that has started hacking their own insulin pumps, and writing their own software to achieve their goals.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s your plan?\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My plan is to make an insulin pump that brings these features to the every day user, safely, and securely. Eliminating the need to hack old insulin pumps, and instead creating an open insulin pump that anyone can make at home, buy, and change as they see fit.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s your budget?\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ive set the goal to this campaign rather low, $90k, the bare minimum I need to get started. Just barely enough to get the design out there, make prototypes, and get the final product into people hands. The ideal goal is closer to $200k. This would cover manufacturing on a much larger scale, legal fees, start FDA approval, and would allow for more time and resources to get the best product out to as many people as possible.\n\n\u00a0\n"

We've heard all your feedback, and are planning to build, from the ground up, a totally new and modernized user interface, designed to bring more immersion, accessibility, ease of use and fun to everyone.\n\n\n\u00a0TOTALLY REDESIGNED CHAT\u00a0\n\nBeside the all new and revamped visual, we focused on redesigning the chat screen so that everything you need is within reach at anytime. Quickly access things like your inventory, character sheets, dice and many other GM actions. Take a deeper look on what we're planning.\n\n\n\nNew Quick Action and Dice Trays\n\n\n\nBETTER DICE ROLLING\n\nOur world famous dice calculator is still here, but in a much more visual way!\nNow you see the dice you are going to roll, keep the most used ones within reach, and also use them with your macros and scripts if you wish!\n\n\nCAMPAIGN INVENTORY\n\nWe wanted to build a place to keep all your character's and party stuff organized: Things like items, notes, equipments (with macros and stats) or money that you will need on the journey.\nGM's, you can take a step further and use a personal library - and unleash your creativity - or the New mRPG Trade Market to always have what you need at any time for your campaigns.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0SHARE AND REUSE CHARACTER SHEETS\u00a0\n\nWe're reimagining our approach on the character sheet to be possible to make them more customizable and, more importantly, to share with your friends and reuse in any campaign of your choice. We also focused on a more welcoming creation flow for new players. Expect also more immersion and new ways to bring your characters to life with the new visual.\n\n\n\nCharacter Sheets will have lots of new features, ease of use and share options\n\n\n\n\u00a0PERSONAL LIBRARY AND TRADE MARKET\u00a0\n\nAnd speaking of reuse and sharing, let's talk about it! Everyone will have access to a Personal Library - to keep items stored for reuse on future campaigns -, and also to a Trade Market - to share or search for other users packs of assets. So how all this works?\n- Users will be able to create, edit and share a pack of assets with System Sheet Template, Pre-built Character Sheets (ie. classes and specializations), Inventory Items and Weapons and Well-known NPC's (like monsters and enemies with simplified sheets).\n\n\n\nCheck out the new ways to share your packs of sheets, items, weapons and more\n\n\n- After creating a pack, you'll be able to store it on your own library or share it with the community in a Trade Market so everyone can add to their personal library and you on any campaign they see fit.\u00a0\n- The market will have a public and an internal mRPG moderation based on a Reputation/Voting System meant to keep the market a healthy place. So you'll up or down vote packs and have a clear and better understanding of what you're using.\n\n\nMUCH BETTER WAYS TO FIND CAMPAIGNS TO PLAY\n\nIn this new version of mRPG we want to put a lot of effort in the Home Screen. So, we're planning on creating a new Discover Tab containing curated sections to show campaigns more likely to match your tastes (i.e. the systems you like, campaigns that fit with your level of play, number of players, and so on). We'll also redesign the Find Games into a News Tab, where you can search for recent and fresh campaigns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, mRPG Web is Beta and is now only available to our Patreon supporters. But in mRPG Second Edition we will bring mRPG Web to everyone, so every player can experience roleplaying using full-sized Keyboard and Mouse and experience a user interface totally adapted to bigger screens, making use of all available screen space to allow still quicker and easier access to all the tools you need while playing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0INTENSE BUG AND ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW\u00a0\n\nWe scanned the app and collected your feedback to map the root causes of bugs and flaws on mRPG and also find out those that most impact the user experience.\u00a0\nThe New mRPG will come to the stores with a smoother operation, that\u2019s for sure! And for that, we're aiming to work on better structures to increase the overall stability of the system.\nThese are some of the improvements and steps we're taking towards better quality of life:\n\nImproved reliability on our messaging system. Expect better chat experience, and no more glitches when loading your campaign messages;\nNew notification structure. Including better user control, faster and more reliable notifications and overall stability;\nOverall app stability to reduce those annoying crashes. This will include broader device compatibility and better monitoring of bugs and issues.\nReview of our search and index services, so you can find what you need on the app\nRewriting most of the code base for a more cleaner and unified debug and develop process\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeeping the mRPG community healthy is not an easy task, but it's one we're definitely planning to work on to improve how things work and ways to achieve a more coherent and efficient moderation system.\n\n\nUSERS REPUTATION SYSTEM\n\nTrack yours and other players\u2019 reputation based on: positive or negative votes received for your participation in campaigns and trade market content quality.\n\n\nBETTER MODERATION PRACTICES\n\n- Extensive review of mRPG's Guidelines to clarify key points for players and moderators.\n- Reports on campaigns and users will be further analyzed and faster taken care off.\n- New tools and information for moderators to make better decisions on bans and suspensions.\n\u00a0\n\nPARENTAL CONTROL\n\nSee the available content based on your age, and on your mobile configurations.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this new version of mRPG you'll be able to experience the App in four different ways:\nFree\nIn this plan, with ads, you'll be able to experience all the new features described above for free! It's a great way to start your journey! And if you want a cleaner and more immersive experience, you can remove the ads for US$12/year.\nPremium For Players\nNow things get interesting. For US$ 5/month you get access to new ways of playing and interacting with everyone!\nSee what you can expect on Premium For Players:\nNEW GAMEPLAY ACTIONS\n\n\u00a0Edit, delete and reply messages.\n\u00a0Story mode, where you can see only characters talking.\nSend GIF's to everyone\nNew ways to express yourself with your profile.

The web version of mRPG currently exists in Beta mode, available only to Patrons, with a reduced number of features.\n\n\nA little bit of history\nDid you know, mRPG started as a very unpretentious project?\nFirstly, it was made to gather a bunch of friends which shared love to RPG but couldn't reach each other in person to play.\nBut then dreams got bigger, the app started to grow and the community followed the rhythm.\nIn few more months, mRPG started to shown as one of apps which people search for when they really want to enjoy good RPG. That also meant more attention from us to the app itself, to make it more enjoyable to our users and this was the point which transformed this small project into big teamwork!\nNew aspirations, new possibilities\u2026 And this huge need to make it real for all users, based on our experiences and desire to create something for each of you, unique players, the perfect place to express yourself through own characters and life, in one handy application.\nNow pack your things, we're moving to a new version with much more fun, are you ready for the New mRPG?\nFree version of mRPG will still be with us, with all the features you know already, wrapped up in a new and better model. But you will also be able to have a full mRPG experience if you decide to be a Full mRPG usar, with a paid plan, in a very affordable price and lots of fun in it!\nThat's why we started project on Kickstarter, we count on you, our community, and we deeply believe that even with the smallest amount of help we are able to make great changes! All the feedback's, all the directions, we know you were showing to us how to make this app better, and we listened.\nThis application exists for you all, for the community, and we will do everything to make it more and more interesting.\nWe want you to enjoy it fully, have fun with us in it!\nSeveral changes are planned for new phase of mRPG, the new era is coming. We count on you and your support to let it begin sooner!\u00a0\n\nWhy did we choose to develop this campaign on Kickstarter?\nTo take new steps and bring our community a richer and more interesting RPG experience, the mRPG project, involving the platform improvements and closer involvement with the community, needs a little more investment.\nOur desire is to upgrade the design and user experience, update the programming and research, so that the wishes of our community and also the values \u200b\u200bof our team can be translated into an app that is fun to use that provides moments of genuine fun to our players.\nWe opted for a crowdfunding campaign so that we don't need to submit to external investors, who might not share our desires and appreciation for the mRPG community. We chose Kickstarter because it is a consolidated platform for this type of action and very focused on creative entertainment.\nWith this crowdfunding campaign, we are taking a very important step towards our dream of transforming mRPG, as a platform, into the best environment of transcendental digital RPG experiences, and for that a lot of work has to be done. Our team is ready and excited. Would you like to join us on this new adventure?"

        "Text": "Hello,\nOur BeePi Project is back with Stage 3! We are a research team in Logan, UT, USA working on electronic beehive monitoring (EBM). EBM integrates hardware and software methods to monitor honeybee (Apis Mellifera) colonies with various sensors in and around the hive. We're enhancing EBM with AI.\nWhy EBM? Because the bees are dying and the climate is changing, and EBM provides continuous monitoring of bee colonies without invasive hive inspections that disrupt natural bee cycles. EBM also supports environment/climate studies, because the behavior and health of bee colonies tell us a great deal about the environment and the climate.\nBeePi is an open design EBM platform we've been developing since 2014. BeePi is unique, because it 1) does video analysis to measure bee traffic in the vicinity of a hive and to generate hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly traffic graphs; 2) does ambient audio analysis to separate bee buzzing from noise and to correlate ambient audio with traffic and weather data; 3) respects the sacredness of bee space -- no sensors are placed on the bee or inside the hive.\nOur goals for Stage 3 are: 1) to port all our video/audio algorithms to the raspberry pi platform so that all data processing is done on a single pi with zero computation/storage in the cloud; 2) to continue and enhance the curation of large video, image, audio, and weather datasets from over half a terrabyte of raw data accumulated in Stages 1 and 2 of the BeePi Project; 3) to make BeePi hardware and software available to researchers, practitioners, citizen scientists, and enthusiasts through project rewards in order to make BeePi \u00a0a global EBM platform.\nIf you're not a techie, there are rewards for you to show your passion for pollinator health/sustainability/Open Science with limited edition seed packages, cool bumper stickers, and slick T-shirts.\nBy backing BeePi you support Open Science -- the practice of science that aims to increase transparency and impact of scientific research beyond the peer reviewed article. Open scientists engage communities worldwide in grassroots collaboration and discussion of scientific research through direct participation.\nDon't confuse Open Science with Open Source (free software). Open Science is not free! BeePi requires funding for hardware, data curation, algorithm design, bee hives, and field experiments.\nDISCLAIMER: Any opinions, views, and positions, expressed or implied, in this crowdfunder do not reflect any opinions, views, positions, or policies of Utah State University or any unit thereof in whole or in part.

To make the system recover itself without any human intervention, we add a \u201cWatchdog Timer\u201d. When some problems occur, LattePanda 3 Delta will restart automatically\u00a0and go back to work normally.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also add the auto power-on function. When the power goes off , no matter in emergency or under normal conditions, the system will boot up automatically once the power is back on.\nWe call these two functions\u00a0\"unattended operation\",\u00a0and hope you can use the board with ease.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor those applications\u00a0relying\u00a0on battery, independent control of the power of all the USB ports and other power\u00a0connectors are essential. \u00a0\nNow LattePanda 3 Delta has made it possible.

        "Text": "I have chronic back issues and have dreamed of lying down while using a computer for years. Yet the only option I could find to buy cost a few grand. Last year, I designed my own, got a prototype made, and have been using it for six months. Now, I want others to be able to have a Lying Down Desk too.\nThe Story\nI've had problems with my back since I was a teenager, which included surgery. Thankfully, I am still quite physically able, but sitting or standing for more than a short period of time are a big problem for me. I can run, climb, do backflips, etc, but chairs are painful.\n\n\n\n\nMy back before surgery\n\n\nFor years I've been trying to find a way to use a computer lying down, yet all I could find that already existed were some expensive models based on reclining dentist chairs with extendable apertures.\nThen, I had an idea: put a monitor under a table, facing the floor. It's simple, but I couldn't find it already done or available online. I tried it out using my tablet, a cardboard box with a hole in it, and a couple of chairs:\n\n\n\n\n\nI sketched a design for a desk, asked a friend to make it, and have been using it for half a year. It\u2019s been as good as I imagined it might be, and I\u2019m in much less pain than before. And I\u2019ve only come close to falling asleep in a meeting once!\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, I want to make it available to as many people as possible, and thought Kickstarter would be the best way to get the first set of orders.\u00a0\nAbout the Desk\nThe Lying Down Desk is primarily aimed at anyone with physical impairments which affect sitting, such as upper and lower back issues. That said, I suspect there will also be a few unimpaired chair users who would also find lying down more comfortable.\nMost tables are about 80cm high, so to get the monitor to be at the right height, there is a hole in the table and a shelf-like unit placed on top of a table which has the monitor installed beneath it. This top unit allows the monitor to be about 95cm from the floor so that it is about 75cm from the user\u2019s eyes. The user has a keyboard either on their lap or on the floor, my recommendation is a split keyboard with half on either side of the hips on the floor. This does mean that the user has to be able to type without seeing the keyboard \u2013 or they have to set up a periscope or video feed to see their hands!\nI do not yet have a finalised design with an agreed person to make it -- I am in discussions with a couple of potential makers.\u00a0So you will receive a desk which matches the design specification, but will probably be a different colour, style, etc, than the CAD image or my prototype.\nWant to make your own?\nIf you see this and think \"oh, I'll just make my own\" -- well that's great, and I'm going to make a PDF document with design, guide to making it, accessories, etc. My main aim is to get desks into the world, not be filthy rich. With the PDF, you can DIY or hire someone to make it bespoke for you.\nI do have a patent pending on this design, so it would be an infringement for someone else to make and sell this design at a profit. 1 licence would come with the PDF so that someone can lawfully make it for you.\u00a0\nIf you are someone who makes desks and you want to make and sell the Lying Down Desk, please get in touch and we can explore working together!\n\nThe Kickstarter\nI already have a finished design and a complete prototype, so am ready to go to potential makers to get quotes and discuss designs, materials and timelines. \u00a0\nTimeline: I've planned for three months to find and finalise a manufacturer(s), three months for manufacture and delivery, and three months safety time.\nIf it turns out that the tables cost less to make than I am budgeting for, then I will use the surplus to give away some desks for free to people who couldn't afford to buy one.\nPDF\nWith the Desk will come a PDF that includes:\n\nFull list of accessories to buy with the desk, such as monitor, keyboard, mouse, USB extender, etc.\nTips on using the desk, different positions for lying down, things to think about with ergonomics.\n\nTyping\nTyping is obviously a big deal for using a computer. You have to be able to generally type without looking to use it while lying down. If you can already do this, then it will just take a couple of days to get used to it. The only problem is when you first lie down, or when you move your hand between mouse and keyboard, you have to find your place again. Most of the time it's alright, but sometimes I hit the wrong key and have to figure out where my fingers are and re-place them.\u00a0\nIt's pretty alright though -- maybe sometime I will do a demo video showing me typing and swapping in realtime!\nSize\nEach desk will be adjusted to the height of the user for the standing surface. \u00a0A standing desk surface should be at or just below elbow height, so that the elbow is at 90-95 degrees. \u00a0After the Kickstarter is completed, I will contact backers to get everyone's details.\u00a0\nYou can either measure your elbow height yourself or plug your height into this size guide for an estimate: https://www.ergotron.com/tools/workspace-planner\nLong-Term Aims\nIf this Kickstarter gets completed, then I'll be really happy that I designed something that other people use!\nHopefully, I will also continue to make and sell more Lying Down Desks and set up as a small business. This initial set of orders will allow me to establish a relationship with one or more cabinet makers who can continue to make them as orders come in.\u00a0\nIf it goes well, I will also expand to be able to sell just the top unit, so that someone can use a desk they already have or buy a second-hand one, and the 2-in-1 Model, which is just for standing and lying, which I expect some people might want because it takes up less space and they already have a table.\u00a0\nMy Values\nIf it goes well, I'll incorporate as a B Corporation, a type of social enterprise which is about positive social impact and not just profit.\u00a0\nI care about disability justice and will be glad to make a project that can help people be in less pain. Anything we do to reduce chronic pain, impairments and disabilities and make people's lives better is a win.\nI care about poverty and economic inequality, and do not like the fact that in our current economic system, people without money have to go without. Nobody should live without their basic needs being met, and if that means needing a Lying Down Desk to be able to use a computer, then these should be available! I will make sure that some Lying Down Desks will be available for free for people or organisations who cannot afford them.\nI care about the natural world. As well as political efforts I am involved in to reduce ecological destruction caused by human activity, when making desks I will investigate how this can be done with as little ecological impact as possible. This will include either reclaimed wood or sustainably sourced wood, and in the future I might also look into using existing or second-hand tables.\u00a0\nFAQs\n- What exactly will it look like? Don't know exactly. It will be the same 3-in-1 design as shown in the CAD images and photos of the prototype, but it may be a different colour, have different legs, etc. If there are colour choices, I will ask everyone for their preferred colour.\u00a0\n- I can just make it myself? Quite! I support this, I like the idea of people making something I designed or modifying the design. If you want to just copy it, nothing stopping you and I don't mind. To make it easy for you, I've prepared a PDF which has drawings of the design, a guide for making it, and a list of all the accessories, and my tips on using the desk, which I think is fair to sell for a small amount.\n- What else would I need? As well as the desk (and a computer!), you would need a monitor to have in the desk and a keyboard and mouse to use while below the desk. If people want, I can buy those in bulk and bundle them together with delivery of the desk to save you the effort (which everyone would have to pay for!).\nIf you are going to swap between lying and standing/sitting a lot, I would recommend having a keyboard and mouse set that stays on the floor, and a keyboard and mouse set that stays on top of the desk. That way you don't have to keep picking and moving a keyboard and mouse! I have the split keyboard on the floor and an easy bluetooth keyboard on top of the desk.\n- Bit expensive? I think it's a fair price. It's a higher price than a standard desk because it is two components, almost like a shelf or coffee table on top of a regular desk. The price is comparable to an electric motor desk that swaps between sitting and standing. \u00a0That being said, I would love for there to be a cheaper version in the future.\n- I'm not in GB? Get the PDF Design download to either make it yourself (either DIY or take the design to someone to make it bespoke). Or if enough people are interested, then we could try finding someone who would make a set of them to make it easier.\u00a0\n- What about accessories etc? Buy: monitor plus keyboard, these may be a bundle if people want it to see if we can get them cheaper. Additional things, USB extenders, mouse, etc, I have suggestions which will be in the PDF.\n- Won't it look a bit weird in the office? lol.\n- What about using a webcam? If you're happy to be on video lying down, then you could get a webcam to use face-down by the monitor.\u00a0\n- What's in the PDF? The PDF which comes with the desk includes: a full list of accessories, eg keyboard, mouse, cables and tips about how to use the desk. The DIY PDF Download also includes design images and a guide for how to make it.\n- The 2-in-1 Lying/Standing Design? This isn't available at the moment, though in the future I hope to be able to sell it. However it is included in the DIY PDF Download if you want to make it yourself!\n- how is the monitor attached? Using a standard mount. They are pretty solid and you can always give it a tug and a wiggle to check it is solid."

        "Text": "\n\n\n\n\nAccording to a report by Statista earlier this year, there are around 4.66 billion active internet users on earth. That is 59.5% of the global population!\n\n\n\n\n\nIt would be an understatement to say WI-FI is a part of many people\u2019s daily lives, especially in the ongoing pandemic. Do you rely on WI-FI? Sometimes WI-FI, as we all know, can become the cause of serious frustration.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll internet users know how frustrating it can be when one minute your WI-FI is working flawlessly, and the next minute, no internet connection is available. This issue is usually caused by bandwidth congestion.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem is that this issue is mostly invisible to the end-user. Rarely do we have the means of prioritizing bandwidth usage to tasks, apps, and devices that matter the most. TANTIV4 routers with pre-loaded Rezrv software, though, give you all the control you need at the tap of a button, and even via voice command. Let\u2019s dive in!\n\n\n\n\n\nRezrv simplifies the management of your network, giving you expert-level control of your WI-FI and internet usage without needing a degree in network management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirstly, we would like you to know that ANYONE can use Rezrv, the web-based Rezrv app that allows tech-savvy users to dive into the more complicated settings that ordinary users would not be too concerned about. Tech-savvy or not, we cater to anyone with an internet connection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREZRV\u00a0 applies bandwidth management policies to your critical applications ensuring that 100% of your Wi-Fi bandwidth is utilized efficiently, as you need it.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur router and software can link to any ISP. It enables you to prioritize applications to eliminate glitches, hangs, and distortion. Policies are easy to configure and adapts to your every bandwidth need.\nKnow who are connected to your Wi-Fi network\nUSERS\nGroup devices and assign them to users, to know if they are online or to check insights of their data usage.\nDEVICES\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0View devices connected to your network, know if they are online or when they were last connected.\n\n\n\n\n\nBANDWIDTH PRIORATIZATION\nHaving a stutter-free Zoom call is probably more important to you than downloading a big file. Customize and select the apps that you want to prioritize as per your need.\nComplete freedom to set schedule to prioritize specific apps at specific time so your busy does not get disturbed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you have set your priorities, all of the above happens behind the scenes!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Reliable Mesh Coverage\u00a0\nNo more dead zones at home or dropped connections. No more buffering. Rezrv\u2019s Mesh technology is designed to deliver high Wi-Fi speeds to every corner of your home, including the backyard and outdoor smart home devices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWI-FI at home can become a battle between family members sometimes as we all know. Whether you work from home, game, stream movies or music, or anything else, there always seems to be one device that drags the WI-FI down!\n\n\n\n\n\nINFORMATION IS POWER\nANALYTICS\nREZRV gives you a variety of powerful analytics into your network usage and activity.\nWondering who\u2019s using the most Wi-Fi data in your house? You can check which device, which user is using the most data. You could also see which app has used the most data.\u00a0\nREZRV also gives information of current top bandwidth hogging apps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, when you are in a Zoom meeting, for example, and your children are constantly on Instagram or YouTube dragging your internet connecting to the ground, simply grab your phone, set Zoom as a priority, and continue to hustle undisturbed!\n\nAnother useful scenario: You are having dinner as a family, and you find that your kids are just ALWAYS on their phones! Open the Rezrv app, whether on mobile or web and deprioritize their devices completely while you spend valuable family time with them!\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can even set times. So, you can set the priority for one hour in the app settings. Do your kids need to do homework? Set your app to prioritize their phones for exactly one or two hours. TANTIV4 routers with Rezrv make your life simple.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre you running a business that relies on internet connectivity? (Which business doesn\u2019t nowadays?) A TANTIV4 router with Rezrv software will be your savior! We all know there is always that one person that is watching YouTube when they should be working. Or, let\u2019s not assume the worst, maybe you need to make urgent calls and the WI-FI seems to be lagging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rezrv apps and software may sound complicated to use, but it is no more complicated than using Instagram or any other app. Rezrv is here to put you back in control of your internet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use our mobile, or web-based application to personalize internet policies or prioritize apps or devices. You will be just a few clicks away from having COMPLETE control of your internet connection.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an example, let\u2019s use Alexa. When you are on a zoom call, tell Alexa: \u201cAlexa, prioritize Zoom.\u201d And that\u2019s it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre you familiar with delving deep into the complicated world of tech? The Rezrv is the perfect internet management software for you! There are tons of special settings on the Rezrv control waiting for you!\nHere are some of the key points that Rezrv controls, as well as what you can do!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEasy to use parental control for monitoring kids' devices & internet usage.\nManage every Internet-connected device on your REZRV network.\nAPP FILTERS\nThere are contents that you would not want your kids to access. You can easily Block such application or websites and customize content.\nTIME LIMITS\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Managing screen time now in your fingertips, parents can take back control of the Internet and limit screen time for their kids.\nPAUSE INTERNET\nTurning off a device\u2019s internet is as simple as clicking pause.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify user preferences in real-time for determining allocations.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaintain reliable real-time connectivity to the Cloud for vital operations.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrioritize conference calls & video call meetings for work.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrioritize Emails and work-related streams over entertainment.\nAdditional Benefits Include:\n\n\n\n\n\nRezrv is always in the background. Our high-powered algorithm software will also know where to send bandwidth and keep out the unnecessary data-eating links, web pages, and apps. So, ads, for example, are a headache for most users on their own! Our adblocker will ensure you are paying for what you can see. There is no point in paying for apps and other internet-based things you do not want or need.\nAnd that is Rezrv! We cover all of your WI-FI needs!\n\nOTHER FEATURES\nSPEED TEST\nCheck your internet speed anddiagnose issues with broadband connection and wireless device speed tests.\nWEBSITE BLOCK\nAlthough App Filters are impressive, you can enter any URL to block website you want to restrict the users on your network.\nDEVICE FINGERPRINTING\nIdentify each device on your network to approve, or pause internet access.\nNOTIFICATIONS\nConnectivity alerts, changes to network settings, and more.\nADBLOCK\nImprove your experience by removing the unwanted pop-up ads.\nAUTOFIRMWARE UPDATE\nAutomatic firmware update delivers latest features and security patches to the router.\n\nHardware Agnostic Software\nRezrv works on different routers:\n\n\n\n\n\nNETWORK SMARTWARE ROUTER SPECIFICATIONS:\n\u202210/100/1000M Ethernet WAN interface for a modem connection\n\u2022Four 10/100/1000M Ethernet (LAN) interfaces for LAN connection\n\u2022Supports 2.4Ghz with up to 300Mbps wireless transmission rate and 5GHz up to 1200Mbps wireless transmission rate.\n\u2022Encryption supported:WPA2-PSK, WPA2-EAP,WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK Mixed mode, WPA-PSK, WPA-EAP etc. Ciphers Supported : TKIP and CCMP\n\u2022Four External 5dBi non-removable antennas for extended range\n\u2022Dual-core 88Mhz Chipset: MT7621A+MT7603+MT7612E\n\u2022SPI Flash 16Mb\n\u2022SDRAM 128 MB\n\u2022Supported network protocols: IEEE 802.11n, IEEE 802.11g, IEEE 802.11b, IEEE 802.3, IEEE 802.3u, IEEE 802.11ac\n\u2022FCC certified\n\u2022Wireless RF power\n\u202211b:18db(max)\n\u202211g:16dbm(max)\n\u202211n:15dbm(max)\n\u202211ac:15dbm(max)\n\u2022Receiving sensitivity\n\u202211N_MCS7_20M: -70dBm@10% PER;\n\u202211N_MCS7_40M: -65dBm@10% PER;\n\u202254M: -70dBm@10% PER;\n\u202211M: -85dBm@8% PER;\n\u2022 Working frequency\n\u2022 2.4 ~ 2.4835GHz\n\u2022 5.15 ~ 5.35GHz\n\u2022 5.47 ~ 5.725GHz\n\u2022 5.725 ~ 5.825GHz\n\u2022Colour Black\n\u2022L x W x H : 143*100*27, N.W : 0.29 kg\n\u2022AC input : AC100-240V\n\u2022DC input : 12V 1.5A Maximum power consumption : <12W\n\n\n\n\n\n$10\u00a0\nBACK IT BECAUSE YOU BELIEVE IT!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTantiv4 is the brainchild of Lokesh and Kishore.

        "Text": "We are at the forefront of scientific communication and discovery\n\u201cThe hardest problems of pure and applied science can only be solved by the open collaboration of the worldwide scientific community.\u201d (Kenneth G. Wilson, Nobel Laureate in Physics). Dr. Wilson was without a doubt on to something. However, even with the creation of the internet, a global collaborative research community has never been done before. Sure, there are online databases of scientists and papers out there, but there\u2019s no global vibrant community for ALL science-lovers to communicate, interact and share research.\nAnd that\u2019s where SciLynk comes in - it is YOUR complete science academia, whether you\u2019re a student, professor, scientist, or casual science enthusiast. We believe by building a bridge between industry professionals and prospective future researchers, we can create a bright future for the world of science. If you are a student seeking to connect with industry professionals, SciLynk can do it. If you are a researcher looking to track research metrics and papers, SciLynk can do it. SciLynk can truly do it all - and we are extremely proud that our network was built meticulously around the feedback of dozens of researchers and students. The feedback we have gotten from them has taken months to develop, and finally, create the best possible platform tailored to their needs. We sincerely hope you can join us in this journey of building the most extensive science network out there!\n\nThe Vision\n\n\n\n\n\nOur goal is to create an open-access network where the physical barriers of institutions no longer separate the most brilliant minds in the world. Imagine a world where the research departments of Stanford, Harvard, MIT, Oxford, and more, are all connected; where they can share research and find the discoveries of tomorrow. Where students worldwide can share their ideas, ask questions, and further their scientific knowledge.\nNot just a network, but a hub that embodies the purest values of research, collaboration, education, and connection.\n\nOpen to everyone - Including you (Guaranteed)!\nImagine John, a curious student looking to get involved with the world of science. He goes to a massive site full of researchers and papers. He tries to create an account, only to see that he cannot access the network without being affiliated with a research institution. He is unable to verify that he is a researcher, and isn\u2019t even able to access the site content - all because he was just a student \u2639\ufe0f\nLuckily for John, Scilynk, unlike other science networks, won\u2019t be restricted by your level of education or research. We believe the best way to spark students\u2019 interest is through interactions with professionals in their fields. Everyone should be able to access open research papers, and viewing research profiles shouldn\u2019t be disallowed just because you are not a Ph.D.\nOpen research means EVERYONE should be able to read and learn from papers, not just researchers, which unfortunately isn\u2019t implemented today. SciLynk will fix that through our free-to-use science platform.\n\nMaking Research Enjoyable\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of our personal favorite features on the site is the gamification system. It combines an element of fun with profound research and collaboration and has been custom-developed using feedback from scientists and professors. In essence, the system uses a well thought-out list of triggers to award different types of points, scores, badges, ranks, and more! The system counts several different points, points for legitimate research and indices for industry professionals, and credits for STEM beginners using the site and collaborating with one another. Points can be used to buy perks and badges on the site. We believe that combining our science platform with a gamification system will allow our users to legitimately enjoy using our site, versus it being a dull hub of articles!\n\nResearch accuracy\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough we want this platform to be available to everyone, we want to ensure our researchers have the best user experience possible on SciLynk. After surveying several professors and scientists, we noticed an overall trend about their dissatisfaction ares with research tracking methods. Large databases use aggressive web scraping and often upload duplicate papers, wrong citation counts, and sometimes even upload the wrong paper to the wrong author. When we asked one of these researchers how many papers they\u2019ve published, they gave us a number in the low 100s. However, their ResearchGate and Google Scholar profiles yielded 400-500 more results. That\u2019s pretty damn inaccurate!\nHow can we possibly fix a problem that companies as large as Google aren\u2019t able to fix? The answer lies in using non-commercial databases that do not profit from the data they collect and use more accurate tracking methods. SciLynk plans to change this - Cambia, the creator of Lens.org, our official Partner, is one of the world\u2019s largest and most accurate scholarly databases!\n\nSTEM Opportunities - Now easier than ever\nRemember our good friend John? Now that he\u2019s gotten a bit more familiarized with the science community, he thinks it's time to level up his game - internship time! Finding a lab internship wasn\u2019t as easy as he thought. \u00a0It meant scouring the internet for contact information and applications, sending hundreds of emails, and then hoping for a couple of replies. Not efficient.\nWith SciLynk, these prehistoric methods are going to be a thing of the past. With simple searches and mutual connections, you will be able to quickly contact professors and researchers and send over your information/resume after introducing yourself! Almost all your relevant information will already be saved to your profile, so you don\u2019t need to worry about copy-pasting and editing dozens of messages to different people.\n\nA new way to connect and grow science\n\n\n\n\n\nSciLynk is built off the uber-important human medium: Connection. Online networking has shown tremendous potential, and with that, we have innovated, thought, and put countless hours into the development of our features. On SciLynk, users will be able to join domain-specific groups, ask and answer questions with our advanced discussion forums, share research papers and track important research metrics, message individuals, and/or participate in group threads, view their activity feeds to see the content that matters to them, and so much more! In addition, we already have plans for podcasts, workspaces, and in a sense, anything the community wants. Science lovers should have a platform where the possibility for collaborative scientific discovery and exploration is customizable and unique.\nWith SciLynk, connecting is as simple as a click:\n\nFind a profile and click connect.\n\u00a0\nThere is no Step 2!\n\u00a0\n\nWe hope to enable meaningful connections between students and researchers to expand their knowledge, and researchers can pass down their knowledge. We also hope to see researchers worldwide collaborating to further progress in science and students working together with others, creating long-lasting bonds.\n\nIntraLynks - A new way to network\n\n\n\n\n\nSciLynk features several science-specific groups and subgroups known as IntraLynks, in which users can join and share updates, media, documents, and more. Users can also create groups, which act as communities of their own with several components to help users communicate with one another!\nSciLynk also features discussion forums, where users can ask, answer, subscribe to, save, and create meaningful discussions. This system features a nested reply system to organize answers and help users individually reply to specific topics. SciLynk\u2019s forums are a great way for users to effectively support each other, whether it is a topic you are struggling to learn in college or an advanced research question pertaining to a paper.\n\nWho we are\n\n\n\n\n\nSciLynk was co-founded by high-school students Arnav Chakravarthy & Arvind Kumar. Two close friends and science enthusiasts, both co-founders are driven to scale SciLynk to be the standard of open research and the go-to platform for anything science. We (Arnav and Arvind) have worked with several researchers and students to get the platform to where it is today, and give our heartfelt thanks to everyone who was with us for the journey.\nArnav, the CEO, is a 15 year old sophomore at Homestead High School. He wants to pursue a career in Biotechnology/Bioengineering and loves reading about general Biology and Chemistry. He manages all aspects of the company, specifically the development and outreach. He spends his free time reading, developing, playing basketball, and watching too much TV. Arnav also happens to be the much cooler co-founder ;)\nArvind, the COO, is a 16 year old Junior at Lynbrook High School. He honestly doesn\u2019t know what he wants to do yet, but he knows it will pertain to tech and medicine or law. He loves playing soccer and reading science fiction books, his favorite being ender's game. He manages the business side of SciLynk including, revenue management, advertising, partnerships, and general operations."

        "Text": "A wallet like no other...\n\n\n\n\n\nHi, I'm Craig and welcome to my Kickstarter! This is the official launch of my new company - Tessellation Studio - and my first product - the Web Wallet.\n\nInspiration...\nMy profession and my passion is additive manufacturing - you might know it as 3D printing. Currently I am a professor teaching additive manufacturing to the next generation of engineers. My students frequently express interest in starting their own companies and launching their products through Kickstarter. As much as I wanted to help, I didn't have the experience to guide them. So I decided I would run a Kickstarter myself so I could learn the process and pass on the knowledge I gained along the way.\u00a0\nHow did I come up with the Web Wallet? Well, quite simply, I wanted to put an additively manufactured product in everyone's pocket. What better way to do that than to create a stylish, one-of-a-kind wallet that everyone wants in their pocket? In the manufacturing world we talk about \"form, fit, and function.\" Throughout most of my career I have focused on function - performance is king, especially in the aerospace world (and rightly so). For my product, however, I wanted \"form\" to be front and center. First and foremost, it had to be visually appealing. I spent a few months sketching my idea on paper, erasing it, re-sketching, erasing again, and on and on until I landed on the design that a) appealed to my asthetic and b) was both additively manufacturable and economically viable. Meeting both requirements was more challenging than I thought it would be. The result is the Web Wallet.\n\n\n\n\n\nI then had to turn my pencil sketch into a 3D model using computer aided design software. Next, I had to turn my model into a solid titanium part using a metal powder 3D printer. Of course that was just one piece of the wallet - I also had to design the two carbon fiber parts that hold the cards, the clip that provides tension and the pieces that fasten it all together.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrototype...\nAdditive manufacturing was born out of the world of prototyping. So I prototyped my initial design and pieced together an 80% solution with machined aerospace-grade carbon fiber, off-the-shelf high-strength steel fasteners, and spring steel. The result is shown in the video below. The wallet holds about four credit cards, one driver's license or ID card, and one insurance card. This was designed around how much I typically carry in my wallet. You can carry less, though you need about 4 cards minimum to hold tension on the spring. You cannot put more than about 6 cards in the wallet, as there is a set distance between the front titanium piece and the back carbon fiber piece. There is still some engineering to do for the final production item - a few modifications to the carbon fiber pieces, custom steel fasteners for the front, and a few other minor design tweaks. The prototype is good - the final design will be even better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomization...\nI have tested some finishing options like iso-polishing and anodized tinting.\u00a0Some people prefer the as-printed finish that clearly shows the layer lines. Others like the polished or tinted options where the layer lines are smoothed out. \u00a0And because we are using 3D printing, we can do fun things like customize the front panel with your name, initials, or other design of your choosing.\n\n\n\n\n\nTessellation Studio...\nThe Web Wallet is only the beginning. I have other high-end consumer products in the works that will follow.\u00a0The proceeds from this Kickstarter will help establish my business and grow my product line. In addition to carrying around the Web Wallet, you can wear our company swag to show your support.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck us out on tessellation-studio.com and follow us on Twitter so you are kept up to date on new product offerings.\nOh, and in case you were wondering, the standard 3D printing computer file is \u00a0\".stl\" - which stands for standard tessellation language. A solid model is converted into an .stl file by covering the surface of the object with a tessellation of triangles. Hence the name and the logo. And now you know!"

These are just some of the reasons why we need private security services. There\u2019s a lot more.\nThese heart-throbbing headlines could have been completely different if proper security measures were taken. We cannot alter our past actions, but we can surely make our future safer and better.\nWe aim to build a secure community by providing a security guard app, Securmo. It\u2019s a platform where every person can hire one of our guards for a wedding, birthday party, business events, and for their home or family\u2019s security. This app has been designed out of a strong desire to establish a safe environment where people can freely enjoy peace of mind knowing that their hard-earned money and loved ones are protected.\nWe are dedicated to offering people a reliable and easy-to-use security application that will provide them protection for everyday life.\n\n\u00a0About The Creator\u00a0\n\u201cI am Remie Mayfallia, the CEO & Founder of Securmo. The story begins with my strong desire to establish a secure society for everyone where we don\u2019t have to worry about our business, property, and family all the time. A lot of negative thoughts come up every day because we live in a society and age where we don\u2019t feel protected. Therefore, I feel the necessity to take security services for my son and family if they\u2019re traveling somewhere. But then a thought crosses my mind that this issue is not limited to a single house and as I have a family, I can sense the pain a person experiences if something happens to his/her loved ones. That was the moment when I decided to provide people with an easily accessible security guard app so that not only big corporations but every common individual can get security services whenever they need them for a very reasonable and fair price.\u201c\n\nVauable Creative Minds Of The Securmo Team\n\nSaba, Lead Designer of Securmo\n\u201cHey, I\u2018m Saba!

For over a year it was merely a dreamy \"what if\" conversation amongst friends that gained enough traction and support for me to go all in.\u00a0\nI've spent the last several months writing requirements, interviewing development teams, and finalizing the design of an app that I cannot wait to give back to the essential oil community. It's a beautiful thing when two worlds collide.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nSAVE\nSave all of your favorite blends and recipes in a single place. No more scrolling through screenshots, searching Pinterest boards, or digging through post-it notes stashed in a drawer.\nBottled & Blended allows you to create a recipe box with your favorite blends by capturing photos, sources, ingredients, and notes for every recipe that supports you and your family.\u00a0\nSEARCH\nWe want to make it quick and easy to find the blend you're looking for. Robust search options not only allow you to search and filter by ingredients and categories, but also by keywords within your custom notes section.\u00a0\nYour recipes are YOURS to save and share. We only surface search results for recipes you have created or saved into your own box, ensuring you have the freedom to notate exactly what each blend supports, uncensored.\nThink of this as your family recipe box handed down from generation to generation.\nSHARE\nArguably the most important feature of the app for us is the ability to share. The foundation of the natural wellness community is the passion to share experience and knowledge. How many times have you been asked \"what oils do you use for this?\" or \"what was that amazing blend you were telling me about for that?\"\u00a0\nWe've designed this app so that you can quickly share your blends and recipes with anyone - even if they do not have the app - via standard text, email, and copy/paste functionality.\u00a0\nWe also make it seamless for the recipient to save recipes that are shared with them directly into their own app for future reference.\u00a0\nSHOP\nClick on any oil or ingredient within a recipe to add it to your wishlist. Pull up your list when shopping so you never forget an oil again.\nWhen you grab that missing oil add it to your inventory with a single tap so you know what you've already purchased and have on hand.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE REWARDS\nWe mean it when we say we couldn't make this app a reality without you and we want to thank you for your generosity and belief in our dream.\nWe worked hard to create rewards that would maximize funds raised while giving back to this amazing community. I'd be lying if I said I didn't have an absolute blast working on these designs and hope you love them as much as I do.\nRewards will be fulfilled as soon as our project is fully funded. We accounted for unknown shipping delays in our delivery estimate, but plan to deliver as soon as we possibly can!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe sure to follow us on Instagram as we have lots of surprises and giveaways up our sleeves to thank you for sharing our story. We really couldn't do this without you!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Coupled with temperature control from our mobile app, Warmee brings comfort and convenience to your home in one snuggly bundle.\nWe believe that when you\u2019re comfortable, you can do anything. Or nothing. Sometimes that\u2019s just as fun.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur patented Invisiwire technology is a game changer. All Warmee products are outfitted with this technology, the first to use spiderweb-thin heating wires that are crimp-free and can hardly be felt. Compare our Invisiwire fibers to other competitors' and you won't feel pins or needles with Warmee. Made from stainless steel and insulated with a Teflon-like material called MFA, they're even resistant to moisture and oxidation.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInconvenience shouldn\u2019t get in the way of rest and relaxation. That\u2019s why Warmee products aren\u2019t just cozy, they\u2019re also made to be as convenient as possible. The blankets are reversible and machine washable, so you won\u2019t break a sweat getting rid of stains. Even struggling to snuggle with your nearest and dearest becomes a thing of the past when the throws are made much larger than those on the market. All in all, Warmee has got you covered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can rest easy knowing that Warmee is better for the environment and for your wallet. Warmee offers up to ten heat settings, so you can turn down the thermostat and curl up under your Warmee blanket or on your mattress pad while reducing your carbon footprint and lowering heating costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re very determined to help lower emissions that we\u2019re partnering with SeaTrees (https://sea-trees.org/), a non-profit that\u2019s helping reforest the planet\u2019s oceans. When you think about it, turning down the thermostat and snuggling under a Warmee blanket really is a smart way to keep warm and help the planet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSay goodbye to that bulky controller on your bedside. With Warmee, we want to give every customer the power to control their comfort effortlessly. That\u2019s why we powered our products with Wi-Fi technology and a sleek, easy-to-use app, which can be downloaded through the App Store and Google Play. Now, setting your alarm and your Warmee product can all be done through your phone. The Internet makes it infinitely easier to do a lot of things, so shouldn\u2019t relaxing be one of them?\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a more connected home with Warmee\u2019s app where you can control all your Warmee products with just a few taps.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce your Warmee products are set up on the app, you can control the temperature however you like. The app allows you to control the level of heat and its duration. When it comes to a king or queen sized blanket or mattress pad, you can control where the heat will come from, on the left or right side of your bed.\n\nAll you have to do is to secure the connector and plug it into an outlet while pressing the power button. With the app, you can set up the temperature and time!\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor ultimate convenience, the app is also compatible with Google Assistant or Alexa, so you can use voice commands to control your products. And with safety features like auto shut-off, you\u2019ll never need to worry about turning your Warmee product off.\nWhen you\u2019re all set up on the app, you can keep it out of sight and out of mind. After all, you deserve a break.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemperature is one of the most important factors that impact sleep. Regulation of temperature has been scientifically proven to improve sleep results, increase blood circulation and muscular flexibility. These make Warmee blankets are a great natural solution for certain types of pain relief, to boost your mood, or to simply kick back and relax.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarmee products, developed with the intention of truly innovating the warming experience and the marketplace, were four years in the making. We took our most challenging and creative ideas to our awesome engineering team who spent many hours developing our Invisiwire technology, removing the annoying feel of wires while retaining the same great warmth. The engineering team also designed the control system that gives us state-of-the-art options for the control and safety of the Warmee products. Then we worked with a solid factory team to complete the process and put it all together to build the present, great Warmee experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarmee is composed of professionals in Home Textiles, Tech, and Engineering with a combined experience of 75 years in the industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are driven to develop products that encourage sustainability and assist in helping people relax. To put it simply, we want our customers to feel more at home, in their homes.\nWith the exciting innovations in home goods now, we felt compelled to develop an all-new, modern collection of heated products that appeals to a new consumer and will change the way they think of electric blankets forever. \u00a0And by creating Invisiwire technology, we believe we have accomplished our goal. We can\u2019t wait for you to see (and experience) our products!\n\nPartners\n\n\n\nbraag - A boutique pre-launch to post-launch marketing agency leveraging data-driven customer acquisition to fuel record-breaking Kickstarters.\n\n\n"

We don\u2019t make portable batteries or smartwatches. Just amazing sounding audio products. This dedication and experience have allowed us to explore the depths of driver technologies that allow the most efficient and resonant sound outputs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo years of transducer R&D work has culminated in our new, proprietary biosynthetic diaphragm horn and ultra-powerful 6mm dynamic coil. Our new driver utilizes a next-generation compound diaphragm manufacturing process combined with the strongest ever magnetic system within a nano-dynamic driver housing. The extremely responsive nature of our driver means the overall sound is full and detailed, unparalleled in definition with any other commercial wireless earbud. Our tuning process has ensured a balanced sound that emphasizes strong sub-bass impact, a natural mid-range, and clear treble. These features unite to deliver a design that immerses you in your music, the way it was meant to sound.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo achieve the most coherent connection and user experience, the FLIGHT features the latest Qualcomm QCC3040 Bluetooth chipset. The latest iteration of its class, the QCC3040 can bring a more stable connection, support higher-quality music transmission, and improve sound quality performance - all while providing efficient battery management. With Bluetooth 5.2 capability, your phone calls can stay more stable, your games and videos are completely in sync with the audio, and you can enjoy a minimum latency experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving worked with numerous professional musicians and sound engineers, we understand that the perfect fit for an earbud is just as crucial as its sound. To guarantee a secure, comfortable fit for every user, we scanned and analyzed hundreds of ears and utilized algorithmic modeling to create a shell shape that best suits the average ear. Medical-grade resin is utilized for each shell for a comfortable and lightweight fit that can be worn for hours on end. Each unit is hand-molded, painted, and polished for the ultimate bespoke experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nFLIGHT is equipped with a 30mAh battery that can provide up to 6 hours of active listening per charge. Furthermore, each FLIGHT comes with a charging case equipped with a 200mAh battery that can extend the usage to 24 hours of active listening or 200 hours of standby time.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FLIGHT is also equipped with Qualcomm\u2019s latest Clear Voice Capture (CVC) 8.0. CVC 8.0 is a noise reduction algorithm that effectively filters out background noise to reduce up to 30dB of unwanted ambient sounds during your phone calls. By accurately calculating the position of the caller in relation to ambient sounds, CVC 8.0 allows a pure sound transmission for cleaner and more audible calls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen FLIGHT is taken out of the charging box, it automatically turns on and connects to the last device used instantly. The super quick and efficient connection mode means less fiddling around on your phone to connect, and more direct listening time to your favorite music. To change or add a new device, simply touch the FLIGHT to easily pair.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapable of fast charge, just 30 minutes of charging can allow up to 24 hours of listening! To maximize the lifespan of FLIGHT, the device features a new overcharge protection battery cell, which means you won\u2019t have to worry about your chargers growing shorter and shorter.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd plan to not use the FLIGHT for some period of time? The FLIGHT can fully power off to minimize battery drainage and pick up right where you left off.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FLIGHT is IPX4 water-resistant, meaning it is safe to be used during exercises and light rain and splashes. Whether you are sweating away at the gym or commuting on an outcast day, the FLIGHT is ready to pump you up with your favorite music.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecure-fit\nAdditionally, the Peacock Flight comes with three specifically designed ear tips for use with strenuous exercise - made with medical-grade silicone, these ear tips are ultra-light and safe on the skin. Combined with the custom ergonomic form factor of the shell, the Flight is snug and secure in your ears. \u00a0On top of that, we have also designed super-soft anti-irritant ear tips as the campaign add-ons that disperse inner ear pressures to allow long-duration uses without any discomfort to the ear canal.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new upgraded chip is widely compatible with mainstream Bluetooth-enabled mobile phones, computers, and tablet devices. You can easily and quickly pair and connect with any IOS, Android, or Windows device simply by taking the FLIGHT out of its case. It\u2019s the immediate connection you\u2019ve been waiting for!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FLIGHT is equipped with Qualcomm aptX\u2122 capable to provide you with High-resolution sound. The aptX\u2122 is one of the best Bluetooth audio codecs for a low-latency transmission. With one of the best latency and transfer rates (up to 24-bit 96kHz music quality wirelessly), aptX\u2122 allows you to experience high audio quality with more efficient power management, lower delays, and better fault tolerances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Project Timeline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are proud of our beautiful and unique shell designs, which are only made possible by meticulously hand-painting each piece to create true one-of-a-kind artwork. The engineering and tuning process necessitates hand soldering and testing of each driver component to ensure the greatest precision and quality control.\u00a0\n\nIn 2018, Linsoul worked in conjunction with \u00a0Peacock to release Peacock P1. Continued with the success of Peacock P1, Peacock Flight lands on Kickstarter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe maintain a strong connection with Chinese HiFi brands in order to offer a curated selection of the very best that Chi-Fi has to offer. We also go a step further in providing customization services so you can acquire a uniquely styled or custom-molded IEM.\nThe founder of Linsoul realized that Hifi music listening should be inspirational and modernly stylish. It can be combined with sound quality and stylish to express your music style.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe got your back\nLinsoul is a company with over 5 years of experience in HiFi Audio providing the best products from China to the rest of the world and has an outstanding reputation with customers worldwide. \u00a0The Peacock FLIGHT comes with a 12 Month Warranty*. Please read the FAQ to learn more about our warranty policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy music with unlimited possibilities\nEvery sound originates from the human heart, the human heart moves, the object makes it happen, and the object moves, so the shape is in the sound, the sound is corresponding, and the result is changed; we give music unlimited possibilities."

Obviously, recurring income and expenses are included in the total calculation. All you need is to enter the expenses you make.\nAll this for just 10\u20ac/year.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "Text": "\n\n\n\n\nMy Story\nHello, I am 18 year old high school senior seeking to launch my first app. Because of my age, I realize that backers may, rightfully so, be doubtful and consider it a huge risk, so I would like to start by telling my story before introducing Quizlarm.\nI have always been an ambitious person with unique goals and dreams. In middle school, I was into classical guitar. I remember playing for hours and hours every day to become what my school called a guitar legend. It was an award given to a student who finished all courses of classical guitar and performed 20 minute recital in front of the school. After 3 years of hard work, I made it. Then, during my Freshman year of high school, I invested tens of hours each week in my school's robotics club. This time, my goal was to make it the world's competition and compete in the international event. Working in hallways by the vending machine everyday, my team and I, for the first time in school history, made it. Then, in my Junior year, after robotics stopped due to the pandemic, I had my first part-time job. Making money for the first time, I studied economy from day to night. This time my goal was to create a sustainable financial asset portfolio composed of growth stocks, dividend stocks, and U.S. government bonds. Finally, in my senior year, I started a community recycling project with group of friends. We dedicated our time to make recycling easy for a community that did not recycle. We distributed 1000 advertisement flyers, trash bags to houses participating, collected the trash bags, sorted aluminums and plastics, removed all labels, and recycled every single items we collected. This time, my goal was to help my community to be more sustainable. I did not list my journey's to just brag and assure you that I am capable. Throughout these experiences, I've learned, what I believe, to be a valuable skills that can guide me through my journey with a Quizlarm project. Guitar journey taught me that diligence and hard work pays off motivating me to always work hard. Robotics taught me to be more efficient and attempt to calculate all the variables that can become risks in the future. Economic studies taught me to manage risks to reduce the chances of failure. Finally, the recycling project taught me execution skills. There will most certainly be hurdles, but I believe I am ready for the challenge.\nIntroduction and Description\nHave you ever had those mornings where you could not wake up? Did you ever miss alarms or used the snooze button too much? Have you ever felt that waking up is just a waste of time? It feels terrible waking up hours after your desired wake-up time, and it feels even worse to feel like you are wasting your time hitting snooze buttons after snooze buttons. I've had similar problems, so I am in process of creating Quizlarm, an alarm app that will guarantee that you wake up with productivity in mind.\u00a0\nHow?\nQuizlarm is an alarm app, and the app will give you a quiz each morning. The user will have to solve the question(s) correctly to turn off the alarm. In other words, the user will have to wake up and solve a quiz to turn off the alarm ensuring that the user wakes up. No more snoozes and no more waking up hours after your desired wake up time.\u00a0\nProductivity?\nThe app will most certainly wake you up, but how will it provide productivity users seek? Most of the quizzes given to the users will be pre-made simple questions that attempts to make the user think. For example, the app will ask users to spell certain words, copy certain motivational quotes, solve medium difficulty math problems, and etc. However, the user will have an option to create his/her own questions. I believe users are the ones that know themselves the best, and they are the only ones who knows exactly what questions to ask them. For example, if Eric has an important English test in a week, Eric can make questions that he needs to remember for the exam, or if Sarah has an important interview that she can not forget in few days, she can make a question to reminder herself of such an event.\u00a0However, if the user does not have any important events, the app will simply provide the users with its questions.\u00a0\nAlarm apps are something people use on daily basis, and if the app reminds you or teaches you an information every single morning, then I believe the user can greatly benefit. Not only will the user wake up on time, the user will start each day productively paving each morning to be the foundation of their success.\n\nProgress\nToday, the app's initial UI and significant portion of development is done. However, \u00a0because the app is not aesthetically pleasing as of today, contracts with external UI designer will be underway in few weeks to improve the apps overall look. Further, because the app needs to connect to a server, I am planning to contact a developer to help me with the finishing touches of the app. According to current plans, the app will be ready to launch in late December or early January. I've included some screenshots from the app for your reference.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Says...\nAccording to the Harvard online resources in the science of learnings section, there is a quote, \"[information] is only kept [in the memory system] through constant repetition\" emphasizing the importance of repetitive learning. Further, according to the article \"Repetition and the brain: neural models of stimulus-specific effects\" written by departments in Stanford University, Cambridge, and National Institute of Mental Health, explains why and how repetition allows the brain to \u00a0stimulate a faster response with greater accuracy. \u00a0As such, it has been proven that repetition improves learning, and I believe repetitive learnings each morning can be an even greater catalyst than simple repetition. The first thing the user sees and experiences in the morning is what the user desires to memorize or learn.\u00a0\nWe are living in a world where the value of the financial assets are rising faster than the value of labor. \u00a0Also, the world's wealth gap is only increasing. The wealth gap between the highly educated and the non-educated population is reaching all time highs. \u00a0So, I think my app can attempt to help solve such a societal problem. I believe my app can help our society take one of thousands of step closer to solving our societal problems by providing repetitive learning each morning prompting the users to be more productive and wake up on time. Changes I bring may be small, but I still believe utilizing the wasteful time people spend waking up each morning can be a change in the right direction for our society.\nKickstarter Fund\nReceiving money should be followed by responsibility, so I will lay out how the funds will be used including how much I am investing in my project. Further, to ensure transparency, for some backers of my project, financial report will be sent that includes where and why each penny was spent.\nAs the chart below shows, most of the money raised through Kickstarter will go to pay for external developer who specializes in server side development and UI designer to make the app more aesthetically more appealing. You may wonder if $2000 raised will be enough to fund such a project, but I will be also investing money that I've saved during my part-time job, this additional capital information will be included in the financial report.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n* The above budget is an estimation and it leaves room for error and taxes.\nI do not know how much money will be raised, but the exact dollar amount will be recorded and some backers will receive financial report to know that the funds were used to kickstart my project.\u00a0\nQuestion\nThank you for reading my story. Please email me at 0329ericlim@gmail.com or reach out in the comment section."

        "Text": "About the Smart Farming Project\nSmart irrigation system is trending for it tailors watering arrangements automatically to meet specific needs, which significantly improves outdoor water use efficiencies.\nSmart irrigation systems can optimize water levels based on things such as soil moisture and weather predictions.\nThis is done with moisture sensors that help inform the system whether the landscape is in need of water.\nWith the improvement of people\u2019s living standards, the quality and safety of agricultural products are attracting more and more people\u2019s attention. Agricultural products must be safe, healthy and traceable in order to make consumers truly reassured in the modern market competition. Therefore, digital farming consisting of LoRa Technology and the Internet of Things is solving the problem over how to feed a rapidly growing population across the globe.\n\nAfter the Covid-19 situation, we know that food sources is another concern that we need to be think about.\nThis Smart Internet of things ( IoT ) system will monitoring the farm required information and then analyse data and will enable the farm to optimse the harvesting of crop.\n\nThis pilot project focuses on collecting, reading and visualizing data acquired from several LoRa WAN sensors deployed in a crop health management solution as plants need to be protected from harmful weather conditions when they are still delicate and particularly prone to diseases.\n\u00b7 Temperature Monitoring includes heat, snow, frost warning\n\u00b7 Humidity Monitoring that control bacteria, viruses and fungi developed.\n\u00b7 Sunlight Monitoring as photosynthesis is an important part of plant growing.\n\n\n\nInformation required for smart farming\n\n\nChallenge\nAs a matter of fact, what is fundamentally significant to smart farming crop health management is temperature, humidity and sunlight data (not saying other factors unimportant). However, it will be difficult to manually check data at times as weather conditions may continuously change during the day and also sunlight is changing accordingly.\n\n\nAbout the internet of Things system,\n\n\n\n\nInternet Of things ( IoT ) Smart Farming system\n\n\nThe integration will need to take a bit of technical know how to integrate those sensors into the system. It will take a few months to get familiarize and set up.\n\nDeployment of Smart Farming\nStep 1: \u00a0LoRa WAN gateway is installed on top of a nearby building with a great signal;\nStep 2: Temp/humidity and sunlight sensors are placed at equidistant locations within certain blocks and generate data;\nStep 3: LoRaWAN gateway collects data from sensors and pushes them to The Things Network platform every 30 minutes;\nStep 4: Users check data in visualized graphs on the application developed by Milesight (you can also use a third-party application server or develop your own application). These graphs are useful to farm operators to modify their corp health management system.\n\nBenefits of Smart Farming\nReduce Cost\nBig money can be definitely saved on labor costs as this project will greatly decrease the number of farmers needed to monitor and tend the growth situation of plants and streamline their operations.\nIncrease Productivity\nFarm operators are able to adjust their plan of soil- and crop-specific fertilization and plant nutrition based on visualized information (temperature, humidity, water content, sunlight, etc.).\n\nAbout Myself\nHi, I am Guan Hock Teo, My kickstart project will involve purchasing a set of IoT Agriculture set up kit, and set it up for trial and testing. The things network platform is one of the illustrated platform. \u00a0In the process, there are many steps and configurations needed to configure cloud and application server. This project will involve doing up a video clip and user manual , to guide the user how to set up their agriculture kit.\n\n.Eventually linked up this agriculture kit to the network server and its dashboard.\nKickstart funder will have the option of receiving the video clip and soft copy of user manual that I do up. They will also have the option to receive a Pledge to smart farming limited edition singlet.\nMy linkedln profile is as follows:\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/teoguanhock/\n\nAppreciated & Thank you."

        "Text": "History/Story.\nMy name is Almonzer Assad from Sudan, African and I\u2019m an Electrical Engineer at the University Of Sudan with an interest/passion for building and designing EV (Electrical Vehicles). For as long as I could remember I loved Bicycles. I loved how they look, the joy it brings people, the community it creates, and the peace that comes with riding bicycles. Growing up Bicycles were the main means of transportation. So I remember how peaceful and quiet it was growing up as the only noises you\u2019d hear are either birds or the familiar bicycle bell ring. Now you can\u2019t even hear the birds as the loud car and motorbike engines took over as the means of transportation.\n\nThe name of my company is Flip. What I make is Electric Bicycles. The million dollar question is why bicycles? This idea came after the tragic events that happened/happening in Sudan since 2018. As a massive petroleum/gas shortage hit the country the prices for this good skyrocketed. This led to many people losing their jobs as means of transportation became almost non-existent. Not only were jobs impacted even worse, kids could not go to school as well. The country was shut down and life stopped all because there were no alternatives. \u00a0Then people started using bicycles as means of transportation which worked for some and for some it was almost impossible because of the distance they would have to cover.\n\nThese events are what led me to this point right now. I decided if I could make electric bicycles that could be affordable for the average household that would not only lead to a cleaner country, it will also mean life would not have to stop if such tragedies occur again The world is evolving at a fast rate and the sad truth is Africa is behind, and so has been the case for decades now. When I watch people like Elon Musk take on the industry and lead the way for a cleaner world I ask myself why can\u2019t I? The world needs change, especially Africa.\n\nThe Budget:\nAs seen in the video I already have a functioning prototype. Most of the money will go into purchasing more bicycles and developing better prototypes.\n\nCost Category Description Phase Expected Total\n\nResearch & Development\u00a0\n\nIncludes buying new bicycles and development of better prototypes\nMaking\n$8,000.00\n_______________________________________________________________\n\nManufacturing\n\nMaking\n$500.00\n_______________________________________________________________\n\nShipping\n\nThis is the shipping cost for the bicycles as I plan to buy in large quantity\nMaking\n$3,000\n_______________________________________________________________\n\nLabor\n\nThis is the time I plan to put in to assemble the bicycles\nOther\n$200.00\n\nTOTAL with taxes = $14,300.00\n\nTimeline\n1. Working Prototype (10/15/2021) - done\n2. License the company (11/06/2021)\n3. Hire an assembly team (11/29/2021\n4. Order Bicycles to start show casing the first patch (12/15/2021)"

Q-tips, ear picks, and other accessories may help, but they may also cause some pain and be less than effective.\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthy ears need to be clean and cleared from accumulated earwax. However, scheduling an appointment with a doctor to have your ears cleaned is not always easy\u2014your busy schedule doesn\u2019t help, or sometimes your family budget will just refuse to stretch. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWith BOCOOLIFE, you can simply use a device with lukewarm water that will clean your ears, making them healthier, without having to waste time and money on appointments you don\u2019t really want to schedule. It also allows you to make sure that your ear won\u2019t be exposed to devices that medical doctors may use on other patients. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nBOCOOLIFE Ear Cleaner works exclusively through its irrigation system that is designed to deliver a safe and effective electrically powered stable water flow. BOCOOLIFE simply uses the volume and pressure of water to push extremely deep and tenacious wax out of your ears. There\u2019s no pressure against the tympanic membrane and no risk to your ears. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0The safe, pain-free, and extremely effective ear cleaner and irrigation system that keeps your family\u2019s ears clean \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasically, the person whose ears are being cleaned will feel as if a water stream is flowing into her ear and coming right out. A very mild sensation of discomfort could be experienced\u2014just because the cerumen is being pushed away from the ear through partial dilution and water pressure. The \u00a0Q-tip will push the ear wax back into the ear canal which might hurt the eardrum and cause infection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent requirements and preferences call for different pressure levels, which is why BOCOOLIFE features four modes that you can choose from based on your needs.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith 4 LED lights and a transparent acrylic water barrier with zoom function, let you observe the ear canal more clearly, and prevent splash.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour ears are delicate and exposing them directly to equipment used by others is not a sterile and recommended way to clean them. That's why the BOCOOLIFE Ear Cleaner and Irrigation System comes with multiple single-use soft ear tips to ensure that each ear tip belongs to you alone and to avoid cross-contamination.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing BOCOOLIFE Ear Cleaner causes mostly no pain whatsoever. Its design and way of working are made for a perfectly safe ear cleaning operation that even unskilled users can quickly master. No side effects are to be expected from an ear cleaning intervention with BOCOOLIFE because this device uses only lukewarm water to effectively clean your ears.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProviding an ergonomic water container that fits well on the shoulders and you could place it on your shoulders to hold the water leftover from the ear washing. You will have a better experience if your friend or family could help you with this!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen designing BOCOOLIFE, we wanted to make sure that the battery was one of its strengths. That\u2019s why we equipped it with a 2000mAh rechargeable lithium battery that charges quickly, ensuring lasting charge cycles for multiple cleaning operations. Once full charge can use for up to 8 hours!\nYour BOCOOLIFE\u2019s battery is here to help you keep your family\u2019s ears\u2014and yours\u2014clean for a long time!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Conventional need to constantly repeat the squeezing operation and it might take a long time to clean your earwax. Moreover, it is difficult to clean stubborn earwax effectively. It would be dangerous, the ear tip needs to be inserted into the ear canal and is easily dislodged.\nBOCOOLIFE Ear Cleaner works exclusively through its irrigation system that is designed to deliver a safe and effective electrically powered stable water flow. BOCOOLIFE simply uses the volume and pressure of water to push extremely deep and tenacious wax out of your ears. There\u2019s no pressure against the tympanic membrane and no risk to your ears\u2014unlike damage that could be caused by other devices, which require an inefficient and harsh manual squeeze and rinse operation.\n\nHowever, if there's a history of ear perforations, ear surgeries, or ear-related pain recently experienced, then BOCOOLIFE should not be used, and you should consult a medical doctor to have your ears cleaned in a clinically recommended way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0The story of BOCOOLIFE began in 2016 when founders\u00a0Sam(an Audiologist) and Alex( a Design Engineer) met. Their first venture was the BOCOOLIFE Ear Cleaner with Irrigation System, and they started with the mission that \u00a0\" easy and effective ear care solution\" This mission hasn't changed to this day, despite the brand's global success and wide range of ear care products offerings. BOCOOLIFE has believed that ear irrigation or ear syringing is a much better solution than cotton swabs, it's true, clean with cotton swabs merely pushes the wax deeper into the ear canal, causing a blockage. So, it should be cleaned in an easy and efficient way. After long-term market research, BOCOOLIFE team decided to develop an innovative and unique ear irrigation kit - \u00a0BOCOOLIFE Ear Cleaner with Irrigation System. It's powerful, durable, easy, and comfortable without hurting to clean ear blockage at home for all ages. The core concept remains the same: A breakthrough in-ear health - cleaning alone is not enough!\n\n\nFactory Image\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarter launches with 1,400+ successful Kickstarter projects and over $500M raised in total.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "Text": "Blincc Hex\nWe know how important it is to be seen when cycling in the dark. Blincc Hex is a 360 degree and dynamic reflector that installs on virtually any bike. Blincc Hex will dynamically spin and always be there reflecting headlights. It gets you noticed while still being sleek!\n\nBut... Isn't reflective decal already normal? So why Blincc Hex? Good question. Let's take a look at it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 Reasons Why:\n1. Super durable with an enhanced protective layer.\n2. Thin & flexible to follow complex profiles and edges.\u00a0\n3. Customised 3M micro prismatic brightness.\n4. Modular design.\n5. Most importantly, simply awesome.\n\n\n\nBlincc Hex Gets you noticed in all angle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Blincc Has Been Seen On:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMAJOR 3M MATERIAL UPDATE:\nPreviously we were using glass beads technology which is flexible. However, after more and more tests we managed to find a better option. We are all familiar with the 3M micro prismatic performance. Blincc Hex is made of customized 3M micro prismatic which is super bright yet it is extremely malleable. Normally micro prismatic will crack on sharp bent. However, Blincc Hex custom prismatic can even be folded!\u00a0it is the best of both worlds :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnhanced Protective Super Strong Layer:\nWe know outdoor can be rough due to particles such as carbon, dust, gravel, debris, and more. So, Blincc Hex is enhanced with an extra engineered protective layer to shield it from potential harm. Would you look at that!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollows Complex Surfaces:\nWe love curves. So does Blincc Hex. Have a sharp aero curve and edges? Don't worry, Blincc Hex will fit in.As mentioned, It will even follow folds!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModular and Dynamic:\nDue to the shape, Blincc Hex will appear different just by pasting it slightly differently. your style your move. Additionally, due to the modularity, any broken pcs during use can easily be changed without replacing the whole set.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEasy Cleaning:\nDecided to go off-road for a shortcut on a muddy path? no worries, it is easy to clean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Both Types Of Brakes:\u00a0\nWhether you are rocking on normal brakes or advanced disc brakes, Blincc Hex won't discriminate. Its size allows pasting on tight spaces easily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlacement:\nWorry less about fitting and sizes, We have designed Blincc Hex to fit virtually any bike due to its size and shape.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can still get Blincclip in this campaign as a bundle.\n\nNo Early Bird Price?\u00a0\nFortunately no. Here is why:\nEarly birds create a perception of urgency. It may be great for creators' sales but we do not want to trigger your impulsive buying for our advantage. We believe in our product as we truly believe in you. So back us only if you find it useful to you :)\n\nStretch Goal.\nHowever, early backers and support will definitely help us to reach further goals. In turn, it will open up more exclusive stretch goals (free upgrades) that will benefit you as our Kickstarter supporter.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecs:\nSmall Hex. 51 x 18 mm at 0.3 grams.\nLong Hex 94 x 18mm at 0.6 grams.\nUniversal size for rims.\nNote: For extra small rim, Blincc Hex can be easily cut and trimmed.\n\n\n\n\n\nFulfillment And Delivery:\nWe have created our Hex and it is ready for production. With your help, we can start mass-producing it early and ship it to you before Christmas Day.\n\n20 October 2021 - Campaign Launch.\n02 November 2021 - Start Manufacturing.\n17 November 2021 - Campaign Ends.\n24 November 2021 - Packing.\n30 November 2021 - Kickstarter Fund Received.\n01 December 2021 - Address Collection.\n04 December 2021 - Shipment Process Start.\n\nHowever please be mindful of delays as world shipment is affected by Covid-19.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Previous Project (Blincclip):\nThe Self Blinking Super Bright Bicycle Reflector.\nWe had a successful first run with Blincclip with over 450% funded with a lot of happy users.\u00a0Blincclip was the first self-blinking reflector that hangs on your saddle or virtually any bag with the included universal string.\n\n\"I got mine today as well and I'm in London so well done on possibly the fastest delivery ever!

Every single day of the week. Our parent-friends were always stuck! Date-night, events, parties, dinners... you name it, they couldn't come.\nSo, we built the 'Uber of childcare'...\u00a0the super-fast low fee NannyPod app.\u00a0\n\nOur Goal\nNannyPod's number one goal is to help EVERY parent in the USA instantly access childcare, whether it's for 1 hour or 10 hours! We make it super easy to make requests with family members, friends, neighbors, babysitters, nannies and infant care specialists. In addition, we help childcare providers pick up jobs at their convenience. Be part of our journey and mission!\n(If we do not reach our target amount your money is returned)\n\n\n\n\n\nWho We Are\nWe care deeply about this industry and our objective is to market the NannyPod app nationwide to parents and childcare providers.\u00a0We are a team of 5 experienced business people, moms and marketers.\u00a0\nCheck us out: https://www.nannypod.com/team\n\nWhat We Have Built\nCompetitor platforms and apps are slow, massively overpriced and some even charge childcare providers exorbitant fees for background checks. Not us!\n\nThe NannyPod app is the 'Uber of childcare'.\u00a0\nIt is free to all childcare providers so you can pick up jobs anytime, anywhere.\nParents pay $8/month to make unlimited requests (or $5 per confirmed booking).\nUse the app between friends, family and neighbors as well as local sitters and nannies\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy We Are Raising Funds\nIn order to make the NannyPod app #1 in the industry for parents, we need to market it in a variety of ways to childcare providers. We use social media influencers, college career websites, sororities, strategic partnerships, Google, Facebook, SnapChat, TikTok and more.\u00a0\nOur mission is to grow our user-base and help every parent in the USA access childcare in minutes, in every town. If you are a mom, dad, parent, aunt, uncle, grandparent, teacher, nurse or childcare provider, you'll love NannyPod!\u00a0\nAnyone can help us reach our fundraising goal. Think of it as everyone helping parents, a few dollars at a time.\u00a0\n(Remember, if we do not reach our target amount your money is returned)\n\nRewards\nWe're offering FREE SUBSCRIPTIONS in exchange for backing our Kickstarter campaign. We greatly appreciate anyone who contributes to our mission.\u00a0\nWe can't wait to market the new super-fast NannyPod app across the USA!\n\nWhich is the Best Value Reward?\u00a0\nThe best value reward is the FREE LIFETIME SUBSCRIPTION. If 2000 people choose this reward, we will exceed our target. Thank you for your support. The more backers we have, the more parents we can help.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Campaign\nThis campaign project is about helping EVERYONE who has children. It's about helping the parenting community. Let's shake up the industry and make NannyPod the leading childcare app in the USA. Thank you.\n\nHello... the 'Uber of childcare' is here.

        "Text": "Help back this pioneering project\u2026. \u00a0\nAre any of you avid crafters? Does anyone (like myself) hoard craft supplies? With the success of some well-known marketplaces online, there is nothing out there solely to buy, sell and destash craft supplies.\u00a0\nResearch suggests there are a large number of different social media platforms, groups, pages and marketplaces where you can buy, sell and destash craft supplies, but no stand alone \u201cone stop shop\u201d designed specifically. \u00a0\nI would like to change that and create The Craft Exchange. It would be the only marketplace specifically where you can buy, sell and destash craft supplies and not only that, I want to create the Craft Exchange community. A community where like-minded crafters can meet up online and chat about anything craft related, share ideas and tutorials as well as access a selection of exclusive videos/tutorials made by craft influencers and professionals to draw attention to the Craft Exchange brand. \u00a0\nThe Craft Exchange would be a peer 2 peer marketplace where users can sign up and create their \u201cCraft Room\u201d.\u00a0\nFrom here they will be able to upload their own items they no longer use or need and also purchase second hand/pre loved items from other users \u201cCraft Rooms\u201d. \u00a0\nAs a user of The Craft Exchange, you will be able to like listings, follow accounts, add ratings and reviews and chat with other accounts about items in their \u201cCraft Room\u201d. There would also be competitions and give always where you can win a number of the paid functions or supplies. \u00a0\u00a0\nPhase 2 - With the upcoming success of The Craft Exchange, going forward with a phase 2, there will be 4 extra paid functions: \u00a0\nThe Craft Exhibit \u2013 This would boost a user\u2019s \u201ccraft room\u201d and increase visibility within The Craft Exchange. It will be visible to more users based on their search/filters/craft.\u00a0\n\u201cNudge\u201d This boosts the visibility of single items and would appear in more users item feed/search results making it visible to the right users.\u00a0\nStar Crafter and The Craft Exchange newsletter \u2013 This will give crafters the opportunity to promote their craft/and or business. This would appear on the main page of The Craft Exchange and on the newsletter\u00a0\nCraft Business Ads \u2013 This would give crafters the opportunity to promote their craft business within peoples search engines. \u00a0\nAlso as part of phase 2, The Craft Exchange would also include a member\u2019s area which would have a small \u00a32 per month subscription fee where users can join the community and access exclusive content, crafting forums and offers available to Craft Exchange members only.\u00a0\nThere will also be a newsletter which will be created on a monthly business. \u00a0\nThe Future \u2013 \u00a0\u00a0I have enjoyed thinking about the future of The Craft Exchange and I have a great list of ideas going forward so here are some ideas:\u00a0\nThe 5 year goal for The Craft Exchange would include a wide range of add on\u2019s to the system including a bespoke Craft Exchange App as well as merchandise. \u00a0Franchise opportunities \u2013 The Craft Exchange sales \u00a0- selling craft supplies and items at one of The Craft Exchange sales \u00a0The employment of staff to support this amazing project and idea \u00a0\nTaking The Craft Exchange GLOBAL! \u00a0\nTo promote the Craft Exchange, marketing will be done via various online and social media platforms which will include paid ads. Leaflets and door to door drops Stalls at craft fairs and shows, Word of mouth and craft influences.\nIf you decide to back this amazing and pioneering project, your money will go towards, the build and design of the marketplace as well as marketing The Craft Exchange over various mediums, as listed above.\u00a0\nIt will also help pay for The Craft Exchanges first years insurance because I want its users to have trust in the business and feel secure using it. \u00a0\nIf I am successful in raising the funds for this project, the plan going forward would be first and foremost to raise a social media presence. This will be done via crafting influencers in the UK, paid adds, words of mouth and contacting various crafting businesses asking for collaborations to promote foot traffic to The Craft Exchange on social media. Whilst doing this, I will be having a logo created for The Craft Exchange.\u00a0\nLast but not least, I will start developing and designing the marketplace with the help of specialist designers ready to go live. The aim would be to get The Craft Exchange live within 6 months. \u00a0\nIf you have any questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to drop me a message, I would be happy to discuss this great venture with you."

No matter our fitness levels, breathing is always one of the biggest factors holding us back.\u00a0\nAnd while traditional breathing practices do work, sessions can be long and may take years to master. On the other hand, the current breathing trainers all share similar problems:\n\nThey look bulky and strange. And you look strange while using them\nThey make you hypersalivate, and cause a stiff lower jaw.\nThey train inhalation and exhalation at the same time building bad habits, exercising mistakes, overlaps, and pullbacks.\n\nUntil now\u2026 Oumua was born out of the search for the perfect respiratory muscle training device for everyday use.\nWe want you to also benefit from breathing exercises \u2014 not just the pro athletes and yoga gurus!\n\n\n\n\n\nOumua combines a healthy breathing habit, with a perfectly balanced user experience and AI-powered technology - with stunning space-inspired aesthetics. Breathing perfection \u2014 at your fingertips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOumua's separated airflow channels allow for faster-exercising results while helping you avoid common mistakes and respiratory imbalances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent sports science agrees with breathing practices and traditions dating back thousands of years, that inhalation and exhalation resistance training should be separated, as inspiration and expiration are commonly perceived as two different processes.\n\nExercising both inhalation and exhalation at the same time is likely to exacerbate the existing imbalances, causing training overlaps and rollbacks. Oumua was designed with this in mind. \nOumua has two separate airflow channels that allow you to perform the inhalation and exhalation movements separately. By gradually tailoring the resistance levels, you\u2019ll progress faster, and avoid common exercising mistakes from other practices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll it takes to gain control of your breathing are 5 to 7 mins of inhalation training in the morning, and 5 to 7 mins of exhalation resistance training in the evening. Experience a noticeable increase in your breathing performance with just these 10 to 15 minutes of daily exercising.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOumua's patent-pending Gradient resistance system guides you through 6 resistance levels, based on your goals, from general well-being to athletic improvement.\n\n\n\n\n\nNothing should hold you back from strengthening your breathing experience. That\u2019s why a slight recess in the center makes it easy to switch between the resistance levels, even in the dark, for people with low muscle tone, and if you have compromised fine motor skills.\u00a0\nOumua also \u201cclicks\u201d every time you change the resistance level \u2014 an intuitive and user-friendly feature for seniors and users with poor eyesight.\n\n\n\n\n\nOumua provides resistance levels tailored for both general well-being and athletic improvement, starting from moderately low 8 \u0441m (3.14 inches) of H2O resistance - all the way up to really hard-to-crack 60 \u0441m (23.6 inches), something even trained athletes will find challenging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOumua Pro is the world\u2019s first personal breathing trainer with a dedicated app powered by Artificial Intelligence. By analyzing your parameters such as age, weight, and athletic condition, the app guides you through each training session, giving live suggestions, exercise compliance, and tracking progress online.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Oumua App, you can measure your lung capacity, adjust training sessions based on compliance, get new training programs, and compete with other users during similar training sessions.\nIt tailors resistance levels and gets performance guidance, helping you avoid respiratory imbalances, overlaps, and pullbacks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe breathing training sessions are built on several core principles like periodization (micro/meso/macro cycles), dynamic resistance increase, and AI-guided conditioning. You can choose (and switch) between 3 main areas:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReady to level up your breathing?\nPre-order Oumua Pro, and select the color (Belize, Rosewood, Azure, Onyx, Pearl, Shamrock, Indigo and add-on colors Blush and Charcoal) via a backer survey after the campaign ends.\nClick Back This Project and select your Pledge Tier.\nPre-order now and pay when the campaign ends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOumua exterior is a reference to nature\u2019s phenomenon, the Nautilus Pompilius, whose shell is a perfect representation of the golden spiral.\nIts minimalist exterior reduces undue attention, and there are no added vibrations, sounds, or sensations \u2014 it's handily sized, user-friendly, intuitive and discrete.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe name is inspired by Oumuamua \u2014 Hawaiian for \u201cfirst distant messenger\u201d \u2014 and the name given to the first known interstellar object to make it into our Solar System.

        "Text": "The goal of this project is to build the prototype for a modular, portable, renewable energy powered (solar and hydroelectric), waste water cleaning and filtration system that can be installed anywhere at a relatively low cost compared to centralized waste management solutions.\u00a0Part of this goal is to test and install the prototype at the Corazon Y Mar waste dump near Rosarito, Mexico that is currently pumping 80,000 gallons of human and toxic waste into the Pacific ocean each day.\u00a0\n\nHISTORY: This project grew out of a toxic waste dumping site that Taillien.com team members found during a clean water project we worked on in Playas de Tijuana in 2020. After researching, we found that there were more than 80,000 gallons of human and toxic waste dumped each day off the coast of Baja California, Mexico about 6 miles south of San Diego. There has been an ongoing project by the EPA and California to resolve unmanaged waste across the border, but this kind of shoreline dumping, in combination with northern directed ocean currents, guarantees that waste will continue to pollute the California shores. For this reason, solutions requiring political and economic incentives are not enough to resolve waste dumping. There is a need for lower cost, renewable energy powered, solutions to clean human, toxic and medical waste.\nOur goal is to build the prototype system at the Corazon Y Mar dump site near Rosarito, Mexico.\u00a0\nTaillien 1 Design\nThere are a wide variety of approaches to water treatment through processes involving biologics, pyrolysis, electrocoagulation, plasma treatment, chemical additives, detergents, filtration and combinations of each.\nFor Taillien 1, we plan on using a combination of electrocoagulation and pyrolysis, powered entirely through solar and hydroelectric, to build a mobile water treatment prototype. Testing will be conducted on the sewage passing through the Corazon Y Mar dump site. The prototype uses an initial, gravity fed, electrocoagulation platform with filtration grating to remove ammonia, phosphates and large sediment. The flocculant is then fed into the inline pyrolysis chamber comprised of a Tesla Induction Coil wrapped around steel piping. The incineration phase will eliminate pathogens and the steam is transported through a long inline chamber where additional magnetized copper coils are housed without the steel piping to complete separation. The remaining effluent is then deposited directly into the ocean.\nWe will be sharing detailed updates of the design, construction and testing of the prototype with our supporters through Kickstarter.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "Text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe BackAware Belt\u2122 is a wearable technology that gives instant feedback on your back position. Allowing for better posture and lifting technique.\u00a0\nWe see so many people doing exercises at home or in the gym with rounded backs and no awareness of their position. We also see this in our daily lives, people rounding their backs to lift objects or just sitting with a flexed spine.\u00a0\nThis is why we created the BackAware Belt\u2122. You can use the BackAware Belt\u2122 in any position for any lift, exercise or even sitting at your desk.\n\n\n\nBackAware Belt\u2122 warns you when you are in a poor position by vibrating\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Visually see your back position with our BackAware App\n\n\nOverview\nThe BackAware Belt\u2122 is:\n\nA technique and posture trainer for better lifting performance\nProvides you with instant feedback on your back position\nUsable in any position, during any exercise and in a range of settings\nUseful in a range of other settings: at your desk or during day-to-day activities that involve lifting\nDeveloped by a Physiotherapist and includes training videos and Back Care plans with the free smartphone app.\n\nBetter Awareness=Better Technique.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Poor technique is often caused by a lack of Awareness of your back position. You just don\u2019t sense when your back is in a poor position.\u00a0\nEven doing core exercises to strengthen your back, unless you are in the correct position these exercises may be ineffective.\u00a0\nThe BackAware Belt makes you aware of your position constantly so that you can have confidence that your are exercising with correct technique. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nNot a Back Belt.\u00a0\nA back belt will try support your back, thus reducing the need for core muscles to work.\u00a0\nThe BackAware Belt makes you aware of your position. You still need to fire and work your own core muscles to keep your spine in the desired position.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe BackAware Belt\u2122 provides instant feedback about your back position by gently vibrating at the belt and also you can see your position on your phone.\u00a0\nImagine a Physical Therapist or Personal Trainer supervising every exercise so that you never lifted a weight or did core exercises poorly.\u00a0\nThe BackAware Belt\u2122 can do that job for you for a lot less than $100 per hour!\n\n\n\nHave Confidence you are doing exercises correctly\n\n\nDesk Version- Additional Feature\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the original BackAware Belt\u2122. We have developed an additional feature for optimal desk use. The original version of the belt can be used at a desk but we have added features, such as delaying the signal and sending notification to your phone instead of the belt vibrating.\nThis allows you to wear your belt discreetly in an office.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack-Aware App\n\n\n\nAndroid and IOS Apps available to calibrate your belt, track your workouts and daily stats and see training videos.\n\n\nFirst of its Kind Technique and posture tracker\n\n\n\n\n\nAll other posture trainers and trackers just tell you if you are upright or not. They do not calibrate to your specific back position. This means you cannot use these when lifting or exercising.\nEvery person\u2019s back is different, so your BackAware Belt\u2122 calibrates to your normal position during ANY exercise or lift. Meaning you can use it exercising, lifting at home or at your desk.\nTrack your Gym, Rehab or lifting technique\n\n\n\nUse the App to see your back position throughout your exercise. This helps improve technique through BIofeedback\n\n\nWatch this short video with creator Eoin Everard PhD demonstrate the use of the app.\n\n\n\n\u00a0Bonus Training\n\n\n\nWe have recorded technique videos for all the Gym, Pilates and Back rehab exercises you will ever need!\n\n\nOn our Training Page of our App you will get access to:\n\u2713 Better Technique for all the key gym exercises.\n\u2713 Better Technique for Pilates and Physio rehabilitation exercises.\n\u2713 Lifting and bending correctly at home.\n\u2713 Healthy sitting habits.\n\nKey Features\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial bonus for Kickstarter backers\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will offer you a free 8 week Sports Pilates or Back Pilates course worth $100 dollars each. These courses have been extremely popular over the past 2 years with over 60 5-star reviews \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\nIn addition to weekly Pilates sessions our course comes with follow along home gym workouts, recipes, mobility sessions and more!\n\nReviews from Experts\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Rewards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe've already completed our first round of \u00a0testing the prototype, refined and launched both Android and IOS apps, We have completed pre-production and beta-testing to make sure things run as smoothly as possible. With the help of Kickstarter backers we can now we produce these belts at scale.\n\nDesign Process\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project has taken nearly 3 years to get to this stage. From sending ideas over to potential engineers. I started working with an App designer and an engineer who both ran out on me when I paid them Christmas bonuses.\nI have since found a great engineering and App development company that have helped me take this idea from my head into a first prototype and then have refined it to the model we have now. We have trademarked the name and have our patent pending. Very exciting.\nThe design of the belt has changed considerably from the first one that was sent to me! My local fabrics shop in Kilkenny, Ireland (Threads of Green) have supplied all my fabrics and I am using local seamstress companies (Zipyard Nenagh) to make the belts here in Ireland. That way we can make sure each belt is the perfect quality.\nEach unit is currently being tested by the engineers and then by our team in Ireland before being shipped.\nShipping\n\u00a0All shipping fees will be collected separately once the campaign is over. Please see below for estimates:\u00a0\nCurrently we are only shipping to the United States, the EU, Canada and the United Kingdom\nShipping estimates for BackAware Belt: \u00a0United States: \u20ac20 | United Kingdom: \u20ac15 | EU: \u20ac10 | Hong Kong / Malaysia / Singapore: Not Available | Rest of the World: Not Available. If interested from Asia please pledge $1 or comment and if we get enough interest we will open this up.\u00a0\n*VAT/Customs duty will be pre-charged for customers in EU countries. In all other countries the responsibility is at time of delivery for the backer.\nFor EU backers only: We will be charging VAT duties in BackerKit once the campaign is over.

We have gone through a lot to get to this stage the prototypes have been tested, in addition with the APP to make sure it is right for you. We want this product to be great and impact people\u2019s lives.\nWe are very confident in our timeline, but it's our core belief to never settle for an average product, so we won't be compromising on quality in order to save time. Should any issues arise we promise to keep you updated every step of the way and deliver you the best quality product as soon as possible.\nSupply Chain Risk: We have built a very capable team that works hard to ensure smooth delivery of all our products. However, processing delays and unexpected shortages can occur. If this happens, we\u2019ll be sure to keep you informed and work to quickly solve the problem. Quality Control Every one of these products will be tested to make sure it is working. When we are happy we will ship it right to you. \u00a0This will ensure that each belt is in perfect condition without defects as it comes off the line. Covid-19 The health and safety of our team and partners is always our top priority. We follow all government-mandated guidelines and always err on the side of caution when it comes to the physical and mental health of our team and partners. Our manufacturing partner for this product is operating at 100% so we are incredibly confident in our manufacturing timeline.\nEnvironmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\n\u00a0\u00a0First Edition- First of its kind for a healthier society. \u00a0\nWill we have other versions of this belt over the years? Hopefully. Will we ever have a first edition again? No. I am hoping this can grow to be something like Fitbit, Peloton or the other great fitness wearables. Imagine owning one of the first 100 Fitbit watches? Or Apple products. That is my hope for this. You will be one of the first to help change the way we lift. Make people aware of their position so that we have a healthier society.\n\n\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 2,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $900M raised between them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured on BackerCrew\n\n\n"

        "Text": "Hi everyone, this is Nick! From my early years, I took a great interest in the entrepreneurial spirit, \u00a0graphic design, and virtual reality. I found myself quietly captivated by the diverse industrial worlds of portable sawmills, Kinkos, California craft fairs, and trade shows. I was drawn to digital creation tools such as Kid Pix, HyperStudio, PowerPoint, and Macromedia Flash early on. I found myself mystified with visual storytelling of early 3D video games such as Wolfenstein and Red Alert 2, carefully researching every issue of game magazines like GamePro as games evolved \u00a0into the massive modern marvels enjoyed today.\nI\u2019ve noticed that all sorts of useful things are starting to feel outdated by the exponential evolution of touch-screen mobile devices, for business or even home application. The time has come for pocket computers to uplift the iconic timeless business tools that business people have always relied on while bringing technology into the current age. It\u2019s a lot easier to understand the modern relevance of these essential tools when seen through the lens of the augmented reality app. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve come up with an idea of making one place where vast numbers of unique business cards can be crafted and experienced coming to life telling their owners' unique stories, and providing options to also present game-like 3D graphics. I chose 3 major mobile device business tools that are vital for any business, based on various business books, studies, and online articles.\nThe rest is history - I researched thousands of educational programming sources looking for coding techniques, concise, and useful info! I have followed the trail to some really hard-to-find corners of the web that had only been engaged in single digits, and of course, used lots of popular online channels and communities where people share the information on a diverse range of coding topics.\nTo ensure it\u2019s easy to explore the collection of business cards, I consulted with over a hundred AR platforms and applications, and collaborated with a team of talented people who got inspired by the idea, and created AR Tool projects of various cool types of printed marketing materials in different styles.\nThe AR & VR Viewer accumulated knowledge of many people of the past and present, and is energized by popular novels, 3D games and movies, resulting in the unique artefact beyond time and space. But this is just the beginning."

Just wipe the surface with a damp cloth after using.\nSay goodbye to your stale coffee and always have the freshest coffee and food.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe apple exposed in the air decomposes much faster than the one stored in the Vacable vacuum condition.\n\n\nFood will oxidize faster when it encounters oxygen, but in a vacuum environment air is prevented from contacting with food, stopping the process of oxidation.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow your food will stay fresh for much longer because it's not exposed to Oxygen! \u00a0Our vacuum-tight environment keeps the air out and that helps maintain the freshness of your coffee beans or whatever food you decide to put in the Vacable.\n\n\n\nNow you can enjoy coffee as freshly roasted everyday with Vocable.\n\n\nThere's also a one-way valve that releases carbon dioxide to extend the life and freshness of your coffee beans and food as well.\nIt's airtight and perfect for keeping mold away for much longer!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA simple push of the button and air is extracted in three seconds.\n\n\nThe lid won\u2019t open when it's vacuum pressured because of our unique science and technology.\n\n\n\n\n\nVacable lids have a unique push-button vacuum seal system that allows the coffee beans to vent CO2 and still keep the oxygen out. That\u2019s that sound you hear whenever you open the lid. The secret lies in the lid! \u00a0It's easy to use and put on - just twist it on - and once sealed, simply click the left button to automatically extract all the air! And when you want to take it off, simply push the right button, and the container will be deflated and ready to open within seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomatically adjust the vacuuming time according to the volume of food in the canister.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Big Enough to Store 1kg Vittoria Coffee Beans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMade Of Food Grade Premium Stainless Steel\n\n\nThe Vacable is made from high-quality stainless steel so it's completely safe for food storage, and won't leach any chemicals into your coffee beans or coffee grounds. The canister can be hand washed with warm water and soap, but the lid is not suitable for a dishwasher since it has an integrated pump. The lid should be carefully wiped with damp clothes.\nVacable will help your coffee beans retain their depth of flavor and aroma by releasing CO2. Its lid will keep humidity at bay and make sure the air is locked out, so your coffee beans stay dry and fresh!\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can store any dry food, ingredients (tea, coffee, sugar, flour, dry foods, \u00a0beans, rice, cookies, coffee, you name it...)\n\n\n\n\n\nLast but not least, you can also store your lovely pet food and keep it fresh for your pet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack freshness to ensure you always have the freshest coffee for you and your guests. On top of the steel clasp, the seal lid is a calendar wheel. Setting the purchase or expiry date reduces waste and puts a stop to throwing precious coffee in the trash. One of the best features of Vacable that you won't find on other airtight containers is our Date Tracker.\nThis feature is actually way more helpful and cost-saving than you might think! \u00a0Instead of forgetting when you stored your coffee beans or other foods, you'll always know when they were stored and if they are OK to eat.\nYou'll save tons of money by not throwing away food all the time because it will last longer AND you'll know how old it really is!\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note: \u00a0The mechanical only comes in white, and the digital only comes in black.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLockedin mainly focuses on the field of vacuum preservation and is committed to creating reliable intelligent preservation products with qualified quality, prolonging the period of food preservation, and reducing waste.\nPeople often throw away food after the best tasting period expires, and the resulting waste of resources is an amazing amount every year. Strengthening preservation can greatly improve this situation from the root, improve the utilization of resources and alleviate the current situation of waste by prolonging the edible time of food. Practicing a strict economy and opposing waste is not only related to cherishing social resources but also means respecting the labor of others. In addition, there is no doubt that preservation is important to retain food flavor and nutrition. High-quality vacuum preservation products can greatly delay the chemical reaction between food and air and ensure its taste and nutrition.\nLockedin hopes to use vacuum preservation technology to create products suitable for the public, meet various storage needs of users, and make use of technology to contribute to the sustainable development of society while improving users' sense of the quality of life and convenience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kFBcdsfSM7D8tF8LaST1f0rXa7QLcvzr/view?usp=sharing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Include the following text: This project is boosted by BackerCrew\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Due to the intrinsic value of metal, once made it is rarely wasted; and with good recovery systems in place, it\u2019s possible to achieve recycling rates of 90%. The entire body is made from aluminum, which is infinite in usage. When the lifecycles of both plastic and aluminum are considered, it becomes clear that aluminum is by far, the most environmentally friendly option.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes you don\u2019t get to choose the environment you will be faced with and when things get wet, you will be glad that you have Rony with you. Rony is armored in premium aircraft-quality aluminum and there is no chance that moisture will penetrate inside and damage the inner components. Snow, rain, showers, or storms won\u2019t take Rony out of service. Rony\u2019s light will lead you through those dark and wet situations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt started with an idea\u2014the idea of a hi-tech and modern flashlight. After countless discussions, we finally realized how the Rony flashlight should be designed and what functions it had to have. At this stage, our industrial designer started to make the first prototype design for Rony.\u00a0\n\nThe first model was very angular, hardly ergonomic, and looked ordinary, like most flashlights on the market. However, by trial and error, we finally integrated the design and made the flashlight more laconic, smooth shaped, stylish, and comfortable to carry. The final prototype was better than we could have imagined and now you can see it for yourself.\nOur first design ideas:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0What\u2019s Inside?\nAs for transparency, we follow the example of Elon Musk. \u0130t is well-known that the Tesla company offers its findings in the open access.We also don't keep our prototype components a secret. To produce Rony, we use durable and premium quality materials. \u0130t can be described as a technical construction with an eye-catchingl design. We hope that this way, you will feel part of the team and see the birth of a unique item with your own eyes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur passion is creating the gadgets everyone will love.

By supporting our passion, you\u2019re helping us as we approach our goal - release the best-designed flashlight. Plus, you get to enjoy the results of our development and innovation first. Thank you!\n\nQuick FAQ\n1. Whether the bike mount is included in the scope of delivery.\u00a0\n- Universal bike light holder is included in the basic Rony kit. It is suitable for all types of bikes as it has a universal attachment.\u00a0\n\n2. How water resistant is the Rony. Can I dive with it?\n- In our experience, no matter how many tests we have done, we have never been able to \"sink\" the Rony. At least the flashlight meets the basic requirements of IP67 waterproofing. Theoretically Rony should be able to withstand deep diving, but no such tests were conducted\u00a0\n\n3. Rony uses two LEDs, does this mean the battery life will be significantly lower than in a classic flashlight with one LED?\u00a0\n- We use a sufficiently large 4200mAh battery which gives the torch a high power reserve. In addition the rear LED \"biom g4 5v\" has a very low power consumption. So overall the runtime of the torch is comparable to top manufacturers like Nitecore or Fenix.\n\n4. Can the battery be replaced with another battery?\u00a0\n- Rony is a flashlight with a built-in battery. The flashlight can be disassembled into components if you wish, but we do not advise you to do so. Your battery will last a very long time, we use high quality Samsung batteries in the design.\n\n5. Why don't you use replacement batteries?\u00a0\n- For your convenience. To charge a 18650 battery, you need a separate charger. Thanks to the battery built in the Rony is a battery charger in its own right. Therefore you only need a UCB-C cord and a power supply to power the flashlight.\u00a0\n\n6. Will my phone charge if I connect it with a Rony.\n- Yes, the flashlight has such a function. Its battery capacity is enough to recharge your phone and not to charge it several times in a row.\n\n7. How long does it take to fully charge the roni?\n- It takes approximately 3 hours to fully charge a fully discharged battery.\n\n8. Is there a warranty on the roni?\n\u00a0- A full one-year warranty is provided on all components. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe warranty does not cover breakage and physical damage to the lantern.\n\n9. Can I use Rony on my bike in the rain? Is it water resistant?\n\u00a0The lantern is protected against splashing water and dust from any direction"

Food, music, dance, art, and locations will be focused upon. The app will work like this; instead of searching for people you will search for places, so let\u2019s travel to the South of France. Once you do so on our interactive maps you will be able to see the people who are there, you\u2019ll be able to view their pictures of said attraction, talk to them while they\u2019re there, and some facts about the location. Want to explore the music scene? No problem, just attractions by music and get a list of local musicians, their history, pictures, work, and if you like them, when you\u2019ll be able to see them playing around the town.\n\n\nOur Goal\nOur goal is to bring a more interactive way to explore the world we live in. Unfortunately, most of us will never get to explore the planet to our content, however, with the help of this app we can see how these places are brought to life by the people living in them. You\u2019ll get to interact with people you\u2019d never otherwise knew existed, see places only the locals know about, and travel the world from the convenience of your phone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

So if you have good Wi-Fi coverage inside your rig it connects to the Wi-Fi and stays online.\nWhat if I do not have reliable Wi-Fi inside my RV?\nOption 2: WalTech has a built-in sim card inside the device. So if you are not in a place where you have Wi-Fi coverage it uses the best available network around that area and helps the device to stay connected always to the internet.\nIs it connected to my personal sim card?\nNo, It is a separate global sim card that can connect to any available cell tower to help the device connect to the internet.\nWhat are my monthly charges?\nFirst, You can activate and deactivate the sim card using your mobile app. So you are only paying for the months that you use a sim card internet.\nFor the months that you use a sim card, there will be an extra charge of approximately $5 per month per sim card.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nBe it home or RV, HVAC systems contribute to more than 50% of energy usage. \u00a0You can save energy and money by analyzing and controlling your system while you are traveling and having fun.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0There\u2019s nothing worse than coming back to your RV after enjoying a day out, only to find that someone has stolen all of your belongings. \u00a0Be it an RV park, storage facility, or your driveway these incidents are incredibly common.\u00a0\nWalTech Smart RV Thermostat comes with a built-in PIR motion sensor so you don't have to pay extra for security systems. \u00a0It will alert you during any suspicious activity so that you can take immediate action to protect your investment.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0WalTech Smart RV Thermostat can be connected to one cooling unit and two heating units. \u00a0If you have two ACs--one in your living room and one in your bedroom--you can install two separate thermostats and accurately measure humidity and temperature. You can connect both thermostats to the same mobile app and control the environment inside your RV from anywhere in the world. \u00a0Wiring details are mentioned below.\nLater, check out our two-pack thermostat pricing offers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegular Smart Home Thermostats like Google Nest and Ecoobee works on 24V AC only. RVs operate on a 12V DC current so thermostats made for an RV should also work on 12V DC. There are a few old RV thermostats out there that work on a 7.5V DC current as well.\nWalTech is the only smart RV Thermostat in the industry with patent-pending technology that can operate from the lowest power input of \u00a07.5 to the highest of 32V in both DC & AC.\nThe comparison chart on voltage and other smart features\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n100% Money-Back Policy by WalTech\nThe biggest problem in crowdfunding after the prototype is manufacturing and bringing the product to the market as promised and What is your guarantee as a backer that you will get the value for your money?\nTeam WalTech is 100% confident about the production and delivery to its backers. If we are not able to manufacture and bring the product to the market as promised, we will refund 100% money to our backer.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have spent countless hours researching and designing these features to make this thermostat truly an All-In-One device so that you don't have to spend money on multiple RV gadgets. \u00a0WalTech is the most Kickass investment for your RV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShipping and fulfillment will be handled by Easyship Collect. \u00a0Due to the current volatility of shipping costs, shipping payments will be collected well after the end of the campaign, close to our ship date. \u00a0This will allow us to present the most accurate and up-to-date prices to pass savings on to you, our valued backers. \u00a0Currently, the approximate shipping charges within the USA are between $9 to $15 depending on your shipping preference.\nIn that survey you will be able to:\n\nPay for shipping costs on the spot\nChoose from three different carriers: Cheapest, Fastest, Hybrid (Best Value)\nFor shipping outside the USA, to avoid delays pay for taxes and duties (if due) on the spot\nFor shipping outside the USA, have the ability to add shipping insurance to the package\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 2,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $900M raised between them."

Add in experience from other Nomads about how to best utilize your time abroad, what tools and software to use, and how to Zoom like a pro so you have more time to experience the local attractions. Together we are elevating the experience and standards as global citizens to enable and empower tourism while working from some of the best locations in the world.\n\nFor those traveling with ZEAL, you\u2019ll gain access to approved hotels with all the amenities needed to work productively and connect with like-minded travelers. Members will receive substantial discounts to our hotel partners and unique ways to leverage and rent out their homes and car to subsidize this quality of life and even stay at top hotels.\u00a0The ZEAL App enables special pricing for reservations and partner products and services through our online shopping features.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pandemic has turned everything upside down and forced the world to go remote. Fortunately, we are seeing many benefits from this digitally connected workforce. Many workers are now able to work when and where they want as long as they have a reliable Internet connection. THIS is a great opportunity for remote workers to live and work in exotic and exciting locations.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, currently the vast majority of \u201cremote workers\u201d find themselves stuck working from home because they lack the knowledge and connections to make it happen. There are just so many questions\u2026 - Is it possible? Is it legal? Is it safe? Are there Internet and hotel facilities conducive for remote working? Who would I spend time together with? What about language barriers?\n\n\n\n\n\nToday\u2019s digital nomads often experience two major frustrations. One, they grapple with loneliness, without a community to connect with, but enjoy the destination. Or two, they struggle with taking time from work, both physically and financially, to live the lifestyle they desire.\n\nYet, the interest in \u2018Remote Work\u2019 is greater than ever!\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a multitude of emerging programs, groups, and retreats developing there is just one major issue - where does everyone go to connect? There is no united Community & No Seamless Experience for Travelers to Remote Work.\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil Now... Luckily, you now have the choice to go remote. You now have the chance to ...\n\u00a0Work... Live... Roam. \u00a0\n\u00a0Anywhere. Anytime. With Anyone!\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWe need your help to build the ZEAL App & the world\u2019s largest online community for remote working. We are bringing together the knowledge, regional information, and needed products and services for remote workers to remove all their guesswork and uncertainty.\n\n\n\n\n\nImagine working remotely with the same comforts of home ... and adventure waiting just around the ... lobby!\n\n\u00a0+ Rewards\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0+ Stretch Goals\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nZEAL Remote is developing an App that is uniting the largest remote working community of brands, destinations, seasoned digital nomads... everything a Remote Worker needs from A to Z to live this active lifestyle, wherever desired.\n\n\n\n\n\nImagine a social platform for ALL things remote - living, working, and lifestyle. Where you could connect with like-minded people around the world with similar interests and hobbies.\n\n\n\n\n\nImagine having all the checklists and resources to seamlessly know how to take the leap, whether it be for a month... or a year!\n\nAs seasoned remote workers having worked intimately in the hospitality and travel sector, we know that not all hotels are well-suited for an extended stay. The needs and demands of long-term travel coupled with the demands of working remotely require different amenities for this type of traveler. ZEAL is collaborating and offering hotels that cater to this extended stay audience where we can curate a community among like-minded travelers.\n\n\n\n\n\nImagine making reservations via the App and then walking into ZEAL-Approved properties that are perfectly suited for the needs of remote workers at a fraction of the cost. Better yet, what if ZEAL could show you how to rent your car and home safely to subsidize an even better hotel for you to adventure from?\n\n\n\n\n\nImagine being connected to and even purchasing all the products and brands employees and employers alike need to work productively, remotely WHILE having time and money to enjoy the destination. Better yet, what if you could get access to explore the best attractions and experiences of a destination and even get rewarded for sharing your own?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, that\u2019s the type of experience we are creating at ZEAL.\u00a0\nWith a background in hospitality and traveling, and a passion to connect people and experiences, we are elevating remote living and making it more accessible to all.\n\nHaving visited a combined 247 countries for some 28.5 years our team has navigated nearly all of the pitfalls, issues, concerns, and awesome adventures a new digital nomad may face. We are translating our missed connections, incomplete paperwork, missing luggage, and lonely overnighters into the communities\u2019 guides for seamlessly and effortlessly navigating how to best travel, work, and play to enjoy our new home away from home.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is a big endeavor. However, the timing is perfect, the technology is ready, and the benefits are huge. With your help, we can create the perfect symbiotic App and Online Community of remote workers who want more from life while helping tourist-based economies that were devastated by the pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport the ZEAL App as a Founding Member and receive lifetime benefits and discounts at our growing network of partner hotels, brands, sponsors, and more.\n\u00a0\n \u00a0Don't be jealous of those living this life... Be ZEALous and take charge of your remote working and living lifestyle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0+ How the Funds Will Be Used\u00a0\nWhile much of the infrastructure exists for this experience in our web-based platform we need to allocate Kickstarter funds to a few areas that will greatly improve the user experience.\u00a0\nWith the addition of travel features and filters that are built specifically for remote workers by remote workers. The platform will receive a new facelift that makes the experience easy and seamless while also developing an App, NEW Desktop and Mobile-friendly experience across devices domestic and international.\n\nWhere we plan on using the funds that are raised, include:\n\n\u00a0Mobile App Creation - Create the mobile app version of the experience that encompasses all the new functionality and subsequent designs with the ZEAL design facelift. Familiar to many of your favorite apps with similarly integrated features the ZEAL App will provide remote workers the connectivity, communication, and resources needed to comfortably travel and work wherever you are connected. The App will be available in both Google Play & iTunes App Stores.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Travel Feature Enhancements - \u00a0Built for community engagement and connectivity, the platform has many of the features that will unite and excite remote workers. However, the travel and remote working related features we seek to add don\u2019t exist, even on other platforms. Through our experience, we will create unique scoring and rating systems for destinations, attractions, hotels, remote working locations and more. These will assist travelers to more easily make lifestyle choices that fit their needs and preferences.\n\u00a0\n\nAre you a traveler looking to live the Remote Lifestyle?\u00a0\nWatch this!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur members will benefit from the Kickstarter as some of those resources will be used to add additional infrastructure that is more travel and hospitality-oriented. Based on some 28.5 years of remote working and traveling we are adding filters and functionality to inform members about the quality and variety of options they have to best suit their personal needs.\n\n\n\u00a0Regional Convenience Scores - Where should you go? Regional information regarding walkability, safety, English speakers, cost of living, how family-friendly it is, and much more will give members great insight into what to expect about the destinations they travel to.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Add Location & Business - \u00a0\u00a0Similar to Google Maps meets FourSquare and TripAdvisor, ZEAL will have businesses, attractions, and experiences that members can add and share valuable information with others.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Hotel Booking & Filters - \u00a0The demands of traveling beyond a few weeks change the type of amenities a remote worker needs. We are building an intuitive solution to search and identify the right accommodation that fits your needs and interests.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Travel Tokens - Users will receive Tokens for their contribution to the community. We\u2019re connecting the gamification of the token system to cryptocurrency for remote workers around the globe to redeem their Travel Tokens for. Earn them by responding to Q&As, upvoting and engaging with content, inviting members, adding a location, review and much more. Use these as digital cash at our partnering hotels and experiences.\n\u00a0\n\nUI / UX Facelift \u00a0- \u00a0\u00a0In adding the new travel-related features it is advantageous to overhaul the entire design and user experience of the desktop and mobile experience. The ZEAL brand aesthetics, simplicity, and flow will be translated into the new platform design. With agency experience and season development partners we will create an incredible user experience that elevates remote working.\n\nCreation of Resources & PDFs & Videos \u00a0- \u00a0\u00a0Consolidating and translating all of the experiences, pitfalls, and successes we are documenting everything that an interested remote worker needs from A to Z. From even exploring where to go, how to get there, regional information, remote working tips for employees and employers, productivity hacks, local gym and event information we are set out to create the ultimate knowledge base for remote workers.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0+ Existing Community Features\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, the platform has this functionality:\n\n\u00a0Chat & Message - Group chat or send messages privately to an individual with the ability to add images, attachments, and more.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Events - Connect online for pre-trip questions you may have or network virtually with people going to the same destination or by a specific interest like diving or coding. ZEAL will also host regional retreats and conferences for our members allowing members to virtually attend too.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Knowledge Base - A database of regional and remote working resources from articles to videos, PDFs, podcasts, and infographics around a wide variety of topics. ZEAL will produce and provide many of these while also moderating user-generated content for quality and safety.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Newsfeed - \u00a0A familiar timeline feed of relevant curated content based on your interest, activities, and behavior. The platform will personalize each user\u2019s experience and content by interest and regional content of their liking.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Q&A Forum - Inevitably questions will arise. We won\u2019t have all the questions answered and often it is just nice to get answers and personal feedback to the travel or work questions you may have. Other members can share their valuable insight and even upvote quality answers.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Rewarded Behavior - \u00a0As members engage, invite, travel and support the ZEAL community they are rewarded for their contribution. ZEAL TravelTokens are real currency that members can redeem at our hotels and brands as real currency. Simply, get value for being of service.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Profiles - \u00a0Each member, business, and attraction will have a profile like it would on Facebook or Google Maps. Search by filters to connect and see what others' experience was like.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0+ Creation of Resources & PDFs\u00a0\nNavigating the trials and tribulations of traveling in remote locations among our community and connections of other seasoned remote workers, ZEAL\u2019s founders have a breadth of experience and recommendations to make this process easier for our members. Members can navigate or search specifically for the information they want as well. A snapshot of some of the resources ZEAL will create include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0+ ZEAL Membership Benefits\u00a0\nAt ZEAL we know that everyone\u2019s desired experience and appetite for travel is unique. So, we are creating the go-to platform for all remote travel, work, and living. Our members can live their ideal lifestyle and personalize the timing, pace, and price tag to their liking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Remote Work Resources & Checklists - \u00a0Step-by-step guides to explore if and how you can easily work remotely. These have best practices and tips from seasoned travelers as well as featured brands and products for each category to seamlessly support remote working with the same comforts of home.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Control of Your Schedule - \u00a0No programs, set dates, or agendas. Your schedule is yours with the autonomy to adventure and explore the world on your own time, whether that is for 1 month, 1 year, or more.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Massive Hotel Discounts - \u00a0Members that reserve their accomodations on ZEAL \u00a0recoup their membership in hotel savings in just one week. With a typical 27% savings for extended stays and an additional 10% off for our VIPs, our remote workers get the best price available for their extended stay with all the rewards and amenities of our approved hotels.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Active Travel Community - \u00a0Our community extends offline, bridging and connecting members around the world to experience a destination and a variety of activities with like-minded travelers. Communities are fostered around activities and interests ranging from surfers, yoga, families, dogs traveling with empty-nesters, and many more.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Peer Recommended Locations - \u00a0As the community travels, they will be rewarded for adding destination attractions from cafes to waterfalls and beaches. They can also contribute their feedback, scores, photos, and recommendations for others to enjoy.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Convenience & Destination Scores - \u00a0Gaining an understanding of the culture and safety of a new destination or even a local cafe will be easy for remote workers to feel confident about their decisions. From seating, noise, and walkability to WiFi speeds and much more, ZEAL arms members with the knowledge they need to find the place for them.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Partnering Brand & Sponsor Discounts - \u00a0Traveling for an extended period while working, requires a different packing list. Aligning with brands and products that serve the remote lifestyle, from smart luggage to extended monitors and VPNs, we are passing these savings on to our members - some up to 45% off from our online store.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Connection to Local Amenities - \u00a0As travelers settle into a location and their footprint expands outside of their hotel\u2019s immediate vicinity many yearn to immerse themselves into the culture. ZEAL connects members to local events, gyms, healthcare, transportation, entertainment, and more to fully experience a destination through connection.\n\n\n\n\u00a0Giving Back - \u00a0While experiencing and getting ingrained into a local culture evolves over time, many travelers find themselves wanting to support and give back to the locals. ZEAL\u2019s Love for Locals campaign supports local infrastructures, our hotel network\u2019s employees, and their families when in need as well as several other local philanthropic efforts, from teaching English to clean up and restoration services.\n\n\n\u00a0+ ZEAL Comparison & Collaboration\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin ZEAL there is a place for everyone. We are uniting all individuals, groups, organizations, associations, brands, destinations, and governments for a more seamless and connected travel experience.\n\nOur perspective is that collaboration by leveraging our connected strengths is far more effective than the competition. While each of the evolving communities, remote working hotels, and shared spaces have their benefits, target market, and experience, we know that each of those is just right for the right individual. Providing the hub to access and choose the ideal experience for each ensures that everyone benefits from this overarching community and infrastructure.\n\nThus, we are taking a different approach here in how we compare ourselves to similar communities and programs. We leverage the strengths that each has while providing the community and platform to educate travelers.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimply, ZEAL is connecting like-minded people, brands, and destinations for an effortless remote living!\n\n\u00a0+ Community\u00a0\nOur experience building communities, communication, and engagement channels for local brands, municipalities, and global travel companies gives our members the ideal platform via an app to engage actively and often. \u00a0Within ZEAL we foster communities around like-minded interests, experiences, and regions so that our members can connect, support, and play online and off.\n\nAt ZEAL, we are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Genuinely Curious - The ZEAL community members have a curious mindset around learning about different cultures, other people, and their growth and betterment.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Actively Engaged - Collaboration is valued over competition in the community. We immerse ourselves into the local cultures, engage with one another\u2019s lives and businesses and show up present and ready to add value.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Connect to Community - Whether it is the native local community or the larger online network of nomads, we encourage social engagement. Zeal members will meet up and share their unique experiences as well as support others in their growth.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Support Local - Light touch. High impact. Leaving the destination in a better place than when we found it takes many forms. From shopping at local grocers and stores to giving back in philanthropic efforts, the community reciprocally supports the destinations they get immersed into.\n\u00a0\n\nWhile we typically are attracting 25- 55-year-olds that are seeking this flexible lifestyle we alternatively are seeing those that aren\u2019t looking to work but to play and enjoy their life, test, and explore the world, and the next place or even places to stay for their retirement can be tricky. Troubleshooting multiple types of technology, social platforms, and apps to get the information and confidence needed to travel for retirees, ex-pats, and empty nesters can be daunting and often hinder them from making the trip at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0+ Network & Partners\u00a0\nAt ZEAL we are not solely uniting members, we are connecting and supporting them by bridging governments, media outlets, brands, and influential leaders. Partnering with governments and regional municipalities wanting exposure to remote workers to come to enjoy their destination, ZEAL is driving travelers for extended stays to bolster regional economies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0+ Expansion & Timeline\u00a0\nZEAL will be a global community connected to elevate remote living and working experiences. First, we have to start regionally and develop the community online as well as onsite. As we develop and grow the online community we will be launching our first location for ZEAL members to work together around the island of Barbados. From there, ZEAL will expand throughout the more prominent, in-demand, and tourist-friendly countries throughout Central America and the Caribbean. \n\n \u00a0Following the trends of where remote workers want to live and those that have the current infrastructure to effectively do so, we seek to expand throughout Europe and Southeast Asia thereafter. Initially focusing on the hospitality industry and supporting its return following the detrimental impact from COVID, we also see many benefits to fostering community through events, dinners, and music at the hotels. From there, we will expand to other villas, homes, condos, chalets, and bungalows around the world among other accommodations that allow them for extended stays.\n\nEqually, we see a large opportunity to enable remote working domestically. Many drive-to destinations have a variety of activities that a digital nomad could enjoy while having the flexibility to drive or fly somewhere else, even home to regroup, and live this adventurous lifestyle. From Moab to Jackson Hole, San Diego to Key West, people could spend a month or a season from coast to coast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0+ About ZEAL & The Team\u00a0\nHaving experience supporting the hospitality and tourism industry from marketing to revenue management, tour operator experience to remote working programs, the Founders of ZEAL united through COVID to make remote working simpler and safer. The team at Social Capital Agency left their downtown office in Denver to work remotely in Tulum and support the leaders in travelers\u2019 rebound. Working under lockdown, connecting virtually, and eager to push the boundaries of the industry to be more customer-centric, more valuable, more connected. They recognized the ability for the world to stay connected and productive outside the normal walls of their offices. Working virtually and leveraging technology for communication, we have seen organizations normalize remote working and the benefits are huge. Remote workers are more productive and happier than their counterparts and these are not the seasoned digital nomads that have years of experience.\n\nSo, why were we not seeing more remote working? \n\n \u00a0Many people were still traveling, and the trends speak for themselves. Airbnb reported that 26% of their bookings for the first quarter of 2021 were for over 4 weeks at a time. We saw companies like Inspirato have limited inventory and be booked out for months. People were still actively paying for travel for extended periods. Yet, the adoption of remote working for a month or a year is not that common. Many have an interest in it but when asking any network of people, there are typically only one or two people that have worked abroad for any significant time.\n\nWhat is the missing link?\n\n\n\n\n\nTraveling for shorter periods is easy. People eat out almost every meal and bring enough clothes for their stay. For longer durations, the lifestyle and habits are very different as a traveler immerses themselves into local culture. The nuances and pitfalls are many and it takes a lot of courage to navigate these uncharted territories.\n\nTo us, it seemed natural, effortless. With our experience and network within the industry, we saw a chance for everyone to benefit. Thus, the concept of ZEAL was born. With one simple question in mind, how do we share what this lifestyle is like to make it easier for others?\n\nWe\u2019ve found many have had the create it and they\u2019ll come mentality. While traveling for less than two weeks maybe that way it takes showing people what the experience of remote working is like and what to expect. Collectively, we decided we had the knowledge, connections, and experience to normalize remote working anywhere that has a stable internet connection.\n\nAs we pursue a traveling series around the world\u2019s best remote working destinations, we decided we wanted to get our community involved and supporting us, provided feedback, and engaging to co-create the best and largest remote working community.\n\n+ \u00a0Follow ZEAL on Social Media\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0+ The Team\u00a0\nOur seasoned team is composed of some of the industry\u2019s best and most innovative businesses in their respective sectors. Covering expertise from marketing and tourism promotion to tour and hotel partnerships for discounts and community managers with a passion for giving back to the local community, we are eager and excited to elevate remote living for all.\u00a0\n\nWe are:\nKathryn has been in the hospitality industry since she was 16. She has held various positions in banquets, restaurants and hotels, and resorts. You could easily say that hospitality is in her blood. She believes the world is a big place and enjoys exploring all types of new places as well as revisiting her favorites. Traveling by plane, boat, train, or car she loves it all! So far, Kathryn has traveled to just under 70 countries. Meeting with people from different cultures and sampling different cuisines rate at the top of her must-do\u2019s while traveling. She is obsessed with travel planning and is known amongst her friends for always finding the very best things to do in every area. With a bucket list that grows every day, she is trying to reach 100 countries in the next few years. She has been working remotely for twenty years and loves the flexibility it provides and the opportunities to travel.\n\u00a0\nTrevor learned that hospitality was his passion when he was 16, working at a restaurant in the Canadian Rockies. He then moved into the cruise industry, where he traveled all around the world with the sole purpose of ensuring that all his guests were cared for and having the time of their lives. He later went to work for hotels and resorts and learned and loved it just as much. When not working, Trevor loves to travel. He is a pilot and can often be found landing at new and exciting destinations. His father planted the travel seed early on, leading by example his dad has traveled to over 130 countries! Trevor has traveled to just over half as much as his Dad and is eager to beat the family record. Trevor has been working remotely for fifteen years and is often seen combining business and pleasure during his travels.\n\nEric and Devon founded Social Capital Agency was founded with the concept of quality of work-life balance, even integration was important. That\u2019s why our motto is 2 Parts Fun and 1 Part Business and we believe that people can be even more productive, healthy, happy, connected, and inspired when they are passionate about the impact they are leaving. With our passion being to empower people to travel and experience the world more easily we work with hotels and destinations to support local tourism economies. As Covid hit and we retreated to Tulum for a month to work remotely we recognized how tough it can be for most to navigate traveling for extended periods and balancing working remotely. \n\n \u00a0We saw an opportunity to share our knowledge, insights, connections, and partners to make remote working more accessible. Supporting hotels and local communities by connecting people and experiences in a seamless way that benefits all may be what our agency does but we are all avid travelers and love connecting with people ourselves. From backcountry snowboarding to scuba diving, climbing and wakeboarding we love supporting the brands that fuel our passion while bringing together communities to support them.\n\u00a0\nTravis and Jason are avid travelers with a passion for remote work and community building. They met as early employees at Remote Year, a venture-backed travel startup redefining how remote workers live and travel.\n\u00a0\nDuring their time at Remote Year, they worked together to build and manage 60+ communities of remote workers, owned internal and external initiatives to build remote culture and planned and executed a series of offsite events. Most importantly, they met thousands of remote workers and learned what made for successful remote companies.\n\nBringing a combined 10+ years of remote work experience along with their record of accomplishment of assisting 1,000's of individuals in their transition to remote work, they decided to create Sprawl Consulting to help usher in the new generation of remote-friendly companies, full of long-term, happy and productive employees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0+ Love for the Locals\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0+ Development Timeline, Launch & Rollout\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "Text": "The Sportneer TrainNTrack Ankle Weights, a first-of-its-kind product for the fitness industry, are integrated with a motion sensor and heart rate chip to monitor workout intensity and performance level, helping everyone from the beginner to the fitness professional train smarter and more intentionally.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Global Industry First\u00a0\nThe Sportneer TrainNTrack Ankle\u00a0Weights are the industry\u2019s first smart ankle weights to help people of all fitness levels train more intentionally.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Highly Precise Motion Sensor\u00a0\nHeart rate monitors and a 6 axis gyroscope sensor, equipped with 3 axes to measure the rate of turn and 3 axes to measure acceleration, enable data collection and track the movements of a workout with high precision.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Big Data Analysis\u00a0\nThe TrainNTrack Ankle Weights have a mega database with a high level of AI learning. The greater the user\u2019s base, the better at analyzing the result of the exercise.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Innovative Materials\nSoft iron stuffing is not only comfortable on the skin, but it's able to hold its shape without being shifted, providing durability, versatility, and comfort for every training session.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. In-App Free Training Tutorials\nIn the current smart fitness market, most systems have a relatively high barrier to entry, especially for the amateur or beginner athlete, with costs ranging from $1,500 to $4,500, not including monthly membership fees for access to classes. The Sportneer TrainNTrack Ankle Weights fulfill the gap of the beginner-friendly smart fitness market and break the high barrier of entry by offering the most accessible and cost-effective equipment and tutorials for amateurs and beginner athletes.\nThe Sportneer App has 8 different training lessons and offers over 71 exercises. The app is free for every Sportneer user and new lessons are updated monthly.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Training Scoring System\u00a0\nTo motivate users to improve, a scoring system is used to provide value to each workout. The higher the accuracy, the higher the score, encouraging users to surpass themselves with each training session through results that are visual and easily understandable.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Heart Rate Warning\u00a0\nA built-in heart rate monitor helps users be more aware of their overall state, performance, and workout fatigue and helps prevent arrhythmia, a sudden cardiac death caused by abnormal heart rhythms. When the heart rate is over the normal interval, the TrainNTrack Ankle Weights will vibrate non-stop reminding the users to take a break, helping them understand when to turn up or turn down the intensity of a workout.\n\n4. Long Battery Life\u00a0\nThe TrainNTrack Ankle Weights were originally designed to last more than 25 hours, meeting daily exercise needs for more than a month. In the new version, we've upgraded the battery life to 35 hours, an increase of 10 hours over the previous version. Further extend the battery life, freeing you from recharging after each training session.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Comfort\u00a0\nUnlike conventional ankle weights, the TrainNTrack Ankle\u00a0Weights are constructed with innovative materials like soft iron stuffing that hold its shape without being shifted, providing durability, versatility, and comfort for any workout.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Trainer Qualification\u00a0\nThe TrainNTrack Ankle Weights were designed with the science of sports engineering and have been developed and tested by Sportneer\u2019s resident personal trainer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. What is a 6-axis gyroscope?\u00a0\nThe technology that supports the scoring system within the Sportneer App is the 6-Axis Gyroscope, which is a sensor with 6 degrees of freedom: 3 axes to measure the rate of turn and another 3 axes to measure the acceleration. To be more specific, it combines the 3 Cartesian coordinate axis accelerometers with a sensor that takes gyroscopic measurements along these 3 axes: pitch, roll, and yaw. Since they are capable of measuring acceleration forces and speed, as well as the orientation of gravity, these sensors are widely used in modern technology, such as in aircraft, digital cameras, unmanned vehicles, and navigation systems.\n\n2. Big Data Analysis\u00a0\nThe TrainNTrack Ankle Weights have a mega database with a high level of AI learning. The greater the user\u2019s base, the better at analyzing the result of the exercise.\nUsers receive a detailed summary of each workout, including statistics on training education, calories burned, and how accurately the exercises were performed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimple yet Effective Exercises You Can Do at Your Desk\uff01\n\n\n\n\n\n Are tough and will work your tail off.\n\n\n\n\n\n Boxing Workouts with friends to Get You in Lean Fighting Shape.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct size, colors, and tutorial on how to measure your wrist and ankle and choose the right size.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSportneer has been serving professionals and amateurs of all ages who love sports, fitness, and the outdoors. Just like the compound word \u201cSportneer\u201d, we successfully blend sports and engineering. In the spirit of healthy living and the pursuit of perfection, we aim to provide the best products and services that enable a stronger, healthier, and happier you! Our brand is rapidly growing thanks to our steadfast commitment to these values. Athletic professionals even agree that Sportneer is a reliable, professional sports brand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "Text": "Samurai by Jet Prod\n\u00a0\nThe Samurai has been something we have been dreaming before we knew what that would be. Windsurfing has been our summer hobby which we did every day! We rarely missed a sunrise without the cool wind in our hair and the sea in our grasp while we glided through the waves. We thought to ourselves; is there something more to it? Then we started experimenting and researching different ways to make the simple surfboard, something which would revolutionize the industry but as always having in mind the reason we try to tame the waves, have fun!\nWe at Jet Prod. Want to create a jet-powered wakeboard which doesn't require wind, is easier to control but harder to master. Creating and designing it isn't an easy task, considering the amount of jet-powered wakeboards out there in the market who have a lot more than 2 people making their dreams come true. Our primary focus is the price, speed of the wakeboard and the weight it can carry. Due to the demand of the wakeboards by the surfing community, our designer and engineer is being extremely cautious in to what kind of materials we will use and the cost of said materials. The Samurai will be efficient, capable of *by approximation* no more than 120kgs/264lbs and keep its retail price lower than the industry average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures of the product\nThe Samurai board will be equipped with:\n\u25cf A carbon fiber impeller\n\u25cf Electronic flaps which will be controlled by the rider on hand and deploy the e-brake (will go into more detail below)\n\u25cf Hydrodynamically shaped slim wakeboard for optimum maneuvers (will go into more detail below)\n\u25cf Maximum Velocity 35 knots (64km/h) 200kgs (440lbs) of force\n\u25cf Jet drive diameter 90mm\nJet prod offers a cozy environment and conducive atmosphere for a great business.

Under the cooperation of a determined and united team of management staff; we are expertly led by an open-minded individual whose dedication to helping others achieve their goals in this extremely important passion.\nWith many years working hands-on with the technology and components used, at Jet Prod, even with the constant and consistent change in the jet-powered wakeboard sphere, we ascertain that our customers will be provided with best tools to have the fun they are promised when trusting our product. Providing our products at a reasonable price, way lower than our high end competitors, is our paramount goal.\nA key factor of business we shall not handle with levity is customer satisfaction. We will ensure the highest quality of services at all time to meet or surpass our customer's expectation. We will ensure that every customer\u2019s needs and requests are duly and properly noted to offer our services to the high standard they should receive. All our services will be customer-tailored and specifically designed to meet & exceed expectations. Up-to-the-minute and workable jet-powered wakeboard production plan will be laid down as elementary as possible for customers to easily comprehend and implement for the company\u2019s success and growth.\nParamount marketing strategies proven to boost business publicity and awareness will be carried out to ensure the necessary awareness and advertisement is achieved for our company both locally and nationally.

The wakeboard which we will supply to our customers may not have the same appeal to enthusiasts as already established wakeboard companies have the market cornered. By utilizing the technological knowledge we possess, we will create a product which will have a price depicted by today\u2019s economy but at the same time be of the highest quality. Since, 3D printing has been made available to everyday users, Jet Prod will invest in this revolutionary method in order to create the small items needed to operate the wakeboard Samurai.\nWe will create the mold for manufacturing the wakeboard and create the water jet by using the 3D printer therefore the cost will be as low as we can possibly so can everybody have access to this experience. The water jets have been made with great success and one of the wake board\u2019s features is the E-brake. Since, not everyone is a professional rider, we will create a mechanism which halts the board the moment the rider loses his balance and falls into the water, the board will be up to 5 meters away from the rider.\u00a0In addition, the E-brake methodology includes a flap creating a camber line larger than the jet surf axis, increasing the lift factor on the back edge of the surf to minimize the time it takes surfs to start planing in the water.\nThe wakeboard itself has been designed to be thin and weigh less than 10kgs and the battery less than 15kgs. The weight is the most competitive aspect in retrospect to other wakeboards in the industry. The electric motor which will be used will be 22kw and will produce 12Nm of torque at 6000rpm. The power of the water jet in static mode (This is the mode when the wakeboard is fully stopped, when it\u2019s speeding the power is increasing above the numbers mentioned above) and the water jet\u2019s motor thrusting force will be almost 200kgs.This has been made possible due to the exceptional design of the water jet.\nLastly, this product will be competitive in the market for these three reasons below,\n\n\u00a0Innovative design\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Mechanically and electrically more weight to power ratio\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Price of the wakeboard 60% less than what\u2019s is available\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the following video we present some footage of testing the first prototype electric surfboard. Everything its our design and creation except electric motor, battery pack and wireless controller.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget Market\nOur company aims to grow in the thriving market of water sports. The water sports market has a steady upward trend and analysts predict that it will keep its upward trend until 2025. The most popular water sports consist of windsurfing, kite surfing and puddle surfing between ages 15 to 50 years old. The puddle surfing's popularity increased due to the global pandemic which came into effect by the shopping boom worldwide. Although, the past year it is slowly began to not be as trending as the early pandemic days. We aim in making the motorized surfing the leading water sports industry. By creating innovative and new surfboard models but also low prices, we are directly competing with the companies which have a large customer list. The demand for this specific water sport is not that great, due to not being as popular as other ones, which we at JetProd have a big inclination to change that. Creating advertising campaigns which main purpose will be to make the customer keen to try this new mode of entertainment, to accomplish that we will sell the board as a mode of \"renting\" on touristic attracted areas and make in known both in Greece and other countries.\n\nSales forecast\nAccording to our research, in the first year the sales will be only from professional water sports rentals in many well-known beaches in Greece. We estimate that in the first year we will have 240 orders at the price of 6.5k\u20ac. In the third year we will present a second model SAMURAI II, to increase the number of sales, and recognition by the public. The second model will be sold with a price increase of 9.5k\u20ac. SAMURAI II will be high \u2013 end board with key features of the automotive industry. At last, the third model will reveal at the end of the fourth year and will be named Aris Pro. Aris Pro will be the first model in the world, with self-charger. With our experience we will include a photo voltaic system on the board, where will powered up the board. Aris Pro price will begin from 10.5k\u20ac. In the fifth year the old models\u2019 price will be discounted.\n\n\n\n\n\nCash Flow\nObserved below is the IRR of five years being operational is 20% and also 29% exponential increasing profit over the five year plan is the Compound Annual Growth Rate. Lastly, we analyzed the risk of having a drop in sales of 30% from year one up to year five the IRR index is still at 10% in the specific five-year span.\n\n\n\n\n\nManagement Team & Organization\nA clear mission gives purpose and direction to every team, in order to reach its goals and overcome every barrier and obstacle. JetProd\u2019s team has a clear mission, to produce an innovative solution and an immense service in the field of water sports fun. Furthermore, our vision is to build a product, which has a great value proposition for the customer and gives him/her a unique sea experience, by using our jet board technology. In addition to that, we want to create something new, smart and differentiated from what is on the market, something that will make us innovators. When you are accompanied by individuals, who have the same purpose with you it is more likely to succeed.\nGeorge (CEO/ CTO): George has an Integrated MSc in Aeronautical Engineering and a BSc in Mechanical Engineering by the National Technical University of Athens. He has been working for 6 years in his business of Household machines service and is specialized in Technical Research and Business Development. George is the CEO and CTO of JetProd.\nNikos (CFO): Nikos has a BSc in Shipping from Business College of Athens. He has been working in his own business with Space Parfums located in Athens. He is specialized in Financial and Marketing Research. Nikos is extremely interested in technology with an innovative mindset. He is going to be CFO of JetProd and head of R&D.\nNefeli (CMO): Nefeli has a Certificate of Music Production / Music Therapy, and a certificate of Yoga Instructor. She has been working for 6 years in a company of Tourism activity and for 4 years until now she has been working in a Telecommunication company in Athens as a CFO. She is very analytical and has the necessary marketing skills. She is going to be the CMO of JetProd.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is our team... so far.\n\nTimeline\nThe following two months will strongly focus on making a friendly workstation for employees and start to design a perfect board. Our target is as long as we design and manufacture the board, we will check it instantly for functionality and about safeties for the rider. At the end of the third month, we will have a tested prototype board where we will start to manufacture this in mass production, and by the time we will start to advertising in social media and in some places with touristic population.\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Contribution\nWith the functional design already laid out, all there is left to do is build the prototype to test and double check to see if any last-minute items should be added or changed. Your investments in the Samurai will make that possible and bring this project to life!\nCreating new designs of hardware and technology can be expensive the first time around, and generate high initial costs for things like tooling, prototyping, sourcing of material and labor costs.\nThat is where your contributions take action. Your pledge will be used towards creating the JetProd prototype, for research and development, and eliminating those obstacles of upfront fees.\nOnce the prototype is created, the tests will involve various \u00a0tests that will be documented before the official release date.\nOnce the Samurai has been tested, tried and proven, the goal is to have it available for ordering online from our website as a final product for all to enjoy on all coasts of the world.\nOur overall goal is to source all materials completely from Greece, which will give opportunities to small local shops. Your contribution will help with that as well.\nYour pledge will also give us a chance to effectively advertise through social media, businesses, online, and through our local beach stores right here in Athens!\nNot only will your contributions help bring the best out of ourselves but you will also give this project and my small business the chance to be seen and heard by others who love to build and create."

        "Text": "My dream was always to be able to study Computer Science, thanks to personal effort and the help of my family, a year ago I managed to start studying for this degree. As soon as I started, I realized that many concepts were difficult to understand. The reason is that I grew up in a Spanish-speaking Caribbean country. Many of the terms were difficult for me despite having lived in the United States for almost twelve years and speaking fluent English. I immediately thought the solution is to start looking for documentation in Spanish. I spent almost a week researching different articles and sources from Universities, however, the more I read, the more confusing it became for me. I realized that I understood less in Spanish than in English. The reason is that many immigrants learn to think in English and forget some words and concepts in Spanish. Another reason is that we are mostly exposed to English in everyday activities, such as listening to music, watching TV, spending time with friends, etc. Then I began to learn these terms in Spanish and English and I realized that my brain absorbed the contents faster. Unfortunately, in this school year I have been able to observe many of my classmate's struggle with the same problems, many, although they are very intelligent and disciplined, do not manage to do well in classes due to the language barrier.\n\nThat is why I would like to open a YouTube channel, a website, and a podcast where I can do tutorials, and write blogs where I help Spanish-speaking students to better understand classes such as Mathematics, Computer Science, Philosophy, etc."

We believe that there are many people who have the same problem like us,\u00a0 it is often difficult to find something suitable that doesn't\u00a0 just stand around somewhere gathering dust.\nBut what does it mean to give gifts?\nFrom our point of view, it's about\n\u00b7 Giving a real and lasting memory to them\n\u00b7 Surprising them\n\u00b7 Touching them\n\u00b7 Make them laugh and\nBeing very close to your loved ones and thus to remain memorable.\nAnd that was exactly the trigger for our innovation, namely to enhance gifts with touching emotions (whether it is vouchers or household aids, billets, etc.) .\nIn order to realize this vision, HALLOTAG developed an overall solution consisting of\n\u00b7 A free Hallotag app and\n\u00b7 A system conforming to an NFC Hallotag sticker\nWith the help of the free app, emotional videos, audios, images and texts can be easily recorded contactless.\nThe one for whom the gift is meant\n\u00b7\u00a0DOES NOT need to download an app\n\u00b7\u00a0DOES NOT need to start any app\nThey simply hold the back of his mobile phone to the sticker and the fabulous winter video or the grandchildeb songs are automatically displayed and played.\nAt this moment the gift is connected to the touching emotions of the winter video, the lovely child's songs. The gift remains memorable.\nThe development was based on the KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid) and is therefore very easy to use for EVERY age group.\nFrom the beginning it was very important for us that we rely on 100% Austrian added value, from conception and development, graphic design and marketing to production. In the fabrication of the sticker, we work together with Austrian social institutions who manufacture the stickers with enthusiasm.\nThe development of the Hallotag system started in 2017. In 2019, a number of test phases were executed in the market to make the system ready for the market. At the beginning of 2020 Hallotag was ready for the market and we started online sales in Austria, UK, BRD, DK.\nFor business partners we developed additional features that are useful for the business partner. We cooperate with, among others, \u00d6sterreichischenPost AG and\u00a0wellness gift provider Wellcard.\nThe company, based in Graz, Austria, has set itself the goal of making Hallotag the global market leader in the field of multimedia stickers.\nWith a team of 15 experienced engineers, graphic artists, social media experts, social institutions and in close cooperation with the Technical University of Graz, we are already working on future innovations for our vision:\u00a0\"Make your gift memorable\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQs Hallotag\nWhat are the advantages of Hallotag over other scanning technologies?\no No app needs to be installed or started to read the Hallotag sticker.\no The Hallotag sticker cannot be duplicated by simply photo copying it.\no The Hallotag sticker can be \"privatized / encrypted\" and only be played back by the person for who the sticker is intended.\no Optical scanning technologies cannot read the scan area anymore due to e.g. dirt, scratches or vandalism.\no The Hallotag sticker can be graphically designed with impressive designs, depending on the customer's wishes.\no Data can be stored directly on the Hallotag\u00a0sticker\nDo I need to register to download the Hallotag app?\nNO, the app can be \"downloaded\" for free from the App Store without entering registration data.\nCan the sticker be scanned without an app?\nYES, practically all Android smart phones support NFC.

        "Text": "Meditation is hard. We want to fix that.\nA stressed-out optimist and an over-thinking realist admitted to each other that they were both meditation failures. After airing all their excuses they realized that there was a common theme; they were both highly distracted by their phones.\n\n\n\nMeet the founders! Tony (left) Ryan (right)\n\n\n\nPhones are distracting\nTony and Ryan \u00a0tried all the meditation apps, but something about the mere presence of having a phone in the room pulled them away from true mindfulness meditation.\u00a0\n\n\n\nPhones draw in our focus and pose a serious distraction\n\n\nThey scoured the interwebs for a basic meditation \u00a0timer, but everything they tried had a startlingly loud and abrasive alarm or overly complicated functionality which counteracted any benefit they had just received from sitting peacefully.\nLet's fix meditation\nSo they decided to design their own meditation timer that was stripped of fancy features like WiFi and Bluetooth, and had one purpose: meditation.\nOur Philosophy\nAs child philosophers, Tony and Ryan wanted this new venture to create a lighthearted and pragmatic approach to meditation, so they came up with the name Pu. This elicits a giggle from their inner child, but also nods to the philosophical concept of Pu or the \u201cuncarved block.\u201d This is the state of pure potential which is the baseline condition of the mind.\nThey hope that this clock will help others find the peaceful disconnect they themselves sought as mindfulness meditation practitioners.\nAs a \"Thank You\" for your support, you will receive your Pu Clock(s) from the first run funded from this Kickstarter. Then you can join Tony and Ryan in ditching the phone; focusing on the here and now, one breath at a time.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull 360 of the PU Clock\n\n\n\nSimple, two-button operation\nThe design is a barebones, minimal cube with two buttons. That's it.You don't need to read a manual or mess around with countless buttons and dials to begin your meditation journey.\n\n\n\nSimple and intuitive design\n\n\n\n\nSetting your ideal meditation time\nWhen not in use, the clock shows the time, but push a single button to switch to meditation mode and add minutes to your timer. Then push the start button and begin your meditation with a singing bowl chime. Simplicity is key in a meditation timer and a meditation practice.\n\n\n\nSetting the meditation timer\n\n\n\nWake up on the right side of the bed\nRyan keeps a beta version on his dresser and uses the built in ascending alarm feature to wake each morning. Again, simple functionality led the way with this feature, so if you can set the time on your oven then you can set the alarm on the Pu Clock.\n\n\n\nSetting the time/alarm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesigning the clock\nTony and Ryan wanted to make the clock aesthetically pleasing, so they designed something that they would like to have on their own dresser, desk, or meditation space.\u00a0\n\n\n\n3-D Design renders of the PU Clock\n\n\nRevisions, revisions, revisions\nNobody gets it perfect on the first try. The PU clock is no different. Between design flaws, cumbersome interfaces, and less-than-ideal tech, Tony and Ryan have taken the PU clock back to the drawing board over and over until it reached its current state: simple, effective, and elegant.\n\n\n\nPrototypes of the PU Clock\n\n\n\n\n\nThe guts of the clock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVoltage: 5V\nCurrent: 500MA\nWork rate: 2.5W\nBattery capacity: 1200MAH\nCharger Style: USB-C"

This is a course that is perfect for those wanting to begin their journey in coding and for those with some programming experience who are looking to explore IOS development. You will learn to make beautiful apps in a way that fits into your busy schedule.\u00a0\nWe are in the information age, and there is high demand for programmers. This is a course designed to help you meet that need. No prior programming experience is required. We will start from the absolute basics, and we will walk together through the process of understanding the basics of swift programming in general before we dive into app development with SwiftUI. We will build 4 fully functioning apps as part of this course, and if we reach our stretch goals, we will build even more.\nThings that you will learn\nBasics of Programming\n\nHow to declare and use variables and constants\n\u00a0\nHow to define and use functions\n\u00a0\nDeclaring classes and structs\n\nApp Development\n\nUsing Xcode, including breakpoints and debugging\n\u00a0\nUsing Github for your git repositories\n\u00a0\nHow to create beautiful views in SwiftUI 3\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Create 4 apps from the ground up, using SwiftUI\n\n\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01) RockPaperScissors - A game against your phone\n\n\n\nRockPaperScissors\n\n\n\u00a0\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02) Quizzer - A quiz app that lets you study or have a game of trivia with your friends.\n\n\n\nQuizzer\n\n\n\u00a0\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03) InvestmentCalculator-Calculate predicted compound interest growth and view current stock and currency values.\u00a0\n\n\n\nFinancialCalc\n\n\n\u00a0\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04) Contect - The Contact Manager for making connections\n\n\n\nContects\n\n\nThings that you will receive as part of the course\n\nThe full source code to all of the demo apps\n\u00a0\nAccess to all course videos\n\u00a0\nAccess to all practice test questions with example solutions to help you learn\n\u00a0\n\nMy Story\nWhen I was about 14, my dad began trying to persuade me to learn to write iPhone apps. There was an obvious need for young people that knew how to code. I got really excited about the idea, but I didn\u2019t connect with a way to start the learning process, and so the idea fizzled, and several years passed. When I was 21, I was again introduced to the idea of learning app making. I jumped on the opportunity, and I have spent the last two years working on various apps every day.\nI started learning to program in Swift, and while studying Physics and Computer Science in university, I was exposed to several other languages including C++, Python, Wolfram, Matlab, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I have spent hundreds of hours writing thousands of lines of code. I have written dozens of IOS applications with varying degrees of complexity, and I am working on bringing my first app to the app store within the next year.\nI have more recently fallen in love with SwiftUI, Apple\u2019s sleek, declarative language for building native applications. Building apps has never been simpler. I look forward to helping you to learn how to use this powerful tool to bring your development to the next level.\nStretch Goals\n$2,500\n\nInclude another Demo app explaining how to use UIViewControllerRepresentable\n\u00a0\nMake a drawing app with PencilKit\n\u00a0\nIncorporate photos into your app with PhotoKit\n\u00a0\n\n$5,000\n\n1 additional demo app for user accounts and authentication\n\u00a0\nIntroduction to Apple\u2019s Authentication Services Framework\n\u00a0\nIntroduction to Firebase Auth\n\u00a0\n\n$10,000\n\n2 additional demo apps using databases\n\u00a0\nIntroduction to JSON \n\u00a0\nIntroduction to Apple\u2019s CoreData and CloudKit\n\u00a0\nUse public, private, and shared databases\n\u00a0\nIntroduction to Firebase/Firestore database\n\u00a0\n\n$20,000\n\n1 additional demo app for learning app monetization\n\u00a0\nIntroduction to In app purchases\n\u00a0\nIntroduction to advertisements in app with Google AdMob\n\u00a0\n\n$40,000\n\nLearn app design for the user experience so that you can take your ideas and transform them into beautiful apps\n\u00a0\n1 additional demo app with subjects of your choosing. Those who have supported at the $20 tier will have the opportunity to vote on the topics covered in this final app. \n\u00a0\n\nWhat sets this course apart?\nFirstly, I have been in your shoes. I have recently been in your shoes, learning how to program, and I have learned from searching through hours of other online sources to learn the things that I have learned. I was often frustrated with tutorials and classes that assumed that I had a lot of background knowledge that I did not have. I felt lost for much of my early experience coding. I want to be able to pass on to you the experience that I have gained from hundreds of hours of learning this material. \u00a0I am excited to make your journey into Swift programming as smooth as possible.\nSecondly, although I have not been involved in tutoring for Computer Science before, I do have experience tutoring in other technical subjects: primarily Physics. I believe firmly in teaching for understanding, and I will do my best to help you understand not just what the code is doing, but also why the code behaves as it does. I care deeply that you understand the material in this course. You will learn by following along line by line, building the sample applications for yourself, and having opportunities to be creative on your own.\u00a0"

I tried everything from hats to sunbeds with canopies and carefully positioned trees or buildings...\nI kept saying to myself: 'I just want something to block the sun from my head, that is simple, inexpensive and easy to adjust as the sun moves'\nSo I mashed together a bracket and a cardboard disc which kind of did the job - but when using my mobile or Kindle, thought: 'What if I could attach my device to the back of the disc?' That's when the SOMBRILL was conceived.\nThree months of samples, testing and discussing the design and we now have the finished, high-quality prototype, poised for production in a reputable Chinese factory.\u00a0\nSOMBRILL is robust, flexible, attractive and versatile. It can be fixed to almost any sunbed, table or armrest and can hold any device up to a small tablet. It protects your face from the harmful sun, while allowing you hands-free viewing of your screen.\nWe just need the funding for the first order of 1000 units - and by this time next year, Rodney...

        "Text": "Thousands of people died on roads all over the world. Someone was riding a bicycle, someone was going along a road, someone had gotten out of a car. Everyone of these poor people could be rescued. They just had to be more visible on the road. Drivers of cars were not able to see them in the dark. Even the brightest clothes are visible in the semi-darkness of the road only when the distance is really short. \u00a0Braking distance of many cars is more than the driver's vision capabilities.\n\nDevelopment of modern technologies lets us change the problem cardinally. Until nowadays, every vest, which is recommended for being visible at the road, is based on the principle of a reflecting light, which is a low-performance solution. Our solution was spied from nature. A miracle, which is created by evolution, is fireflies. They have an ultra-small size of their bodies, but they are visible even in a dark deep forest. These small, but smart creatures are able to attract attention everywhere. As soon as fireflies have appeared at a field, everyone knows it. Firefly is sort of a progressive lighthouse of evolution.\n\nOur Vest is made of special fabric, which is developed specially for bright illumination in the darkness. Thousands of light-conducting fibers transmit the LEDs\u2019 light, therefore the whole vest turns into one big firefly, into a big flashlight, which is impossible not to notice either it\u2019s dark or just cloudy weather. And if several people, who are standing together, will wear the vest, they turn into one big bright spot of light, which is visible at the distance of several hundreds meters in all weather.\n\nThe development of these vests is a breakthrough in the sphere of road security. \u00a0Vest \u201cFireflies\u201d works perfectly in any weather, in any temperature. Everything is easy: Dress it up and turn it on and you will be wondered how bright you are and how much attention you have attracted!\n\nBuilt-in pocket small high-power batteries could be charged as easily as your phone, just connect the charger to USB. The vest is assembled reliably. It lets you take \u00a0long extreme bicycle trips or other types of trips. Our vest \u201cFireflies\u201d is also useful for \u00a0children, who will not get lost in a forest. A bicycle trip with children also becomes safe.\n\nThe production of vests of new generation is our family business. \u00a0Making income is not our first purpose. The biggest award for us would be hundreds of children and bicyclists, who will be lighting up their road in the darkness of the evening like lighthouses. Our mission is creating a safe environment for everyone, who needs to be more visible in the park , in a country, on the road. My children like to ride a bike, scooter, skateboard and they will do it only with vest \u201cfireflies\u201d. Another direction is electric scooters, they have a small size and high speed unlike bicycles. they are less visible therefore riding an electric scooter without the lightning vest is madness. Let the advances of technology protect the safety of your rest.\n\nYour donations are necessary for the acceleration of engineering for the benefits of all humanity. We will purchase a special fabric, make devices for cutting and creating a luminous cloth. We will assemble, pack and ship the finished product. We will create a quality control structure at all stages of our production.\n Our inventions and developments will not leave you unnoticed.\n\nThe first vest that produces light.\nAll other vests are designed on the principle of \u201creturning\u201d of reflected light, our vest is the source of light. It\u2019s designed specially for bicyclists and people, who are on the road at night. The vest is made of luminous fabric. The fabric is made from a variety of intertwined glass fibers, through which low-voltage current flows from the battery, which lies in the inner pocket. The cloth of fabric replaces hundreds of small LEDs connected in one continuous carpet of fire. The battery is securely attached in the pocket. The microswitch allows you to instantly turn on the bright light source. The vest is perfectly visible from a few hundred meters away. The built-in battery will surely last for 6-8 hours of walking. It is possible to increase the working time. To do this, you just need to put another battery. The batteries are charged via the USB connector. The vest is not afraid of moisture, precipitation. It works confidently in a large temperature range. A huge time resource of glowing elements. Three sizes are available for ordering: S, M, XL; adjustment straps are provided on the side.\n\nTake care of the safety of yourself and your loved ones. In the vest \"fireflies\" you will become more noticeable, you are perfectly visible, even in the worst weather. \"fireflies\" - a lighthouse in the sea of madness of darkness. The vest is reliably protected and is not subject to shaking and vibration during long walks on a bicycle, scooter, moped. A great innovative replacement for the well-served, but still rapidly losing its position, classic, good old reflective vest.\n Modern technologies will take under their wing the protection of your security.\nThe new reality requires new solutions.\n\nOur site in the web: http://firefliesvest.tilda.ws/eng\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It is precisely because of this that the 50\u00a0mm focal length can be adapted to shooting in a wide range of fields such as portraits, street photography, scenery, pets, and food.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeeChan\u00a0uses a durable alloy\u00a0bayonet\u00a0and the matte metal silver design is used on manual aperture \u00a0the with the camera, it looks magnificent and has a high degree of recognition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe optical structure of the YeeChan\u00a0is 11 elements in 11 groups. YeeChan\u00a0also uses\u00a0multi-layer\u00a0coating with good anti-reflection effect, which can increase the transmittance of the lens, effectively suppress the glare and ghost caused by the light source in the picture, and reduce the influence of backlight on imaging. Brings a clear and transparent photo effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Minimum Focusing Distance of the lens has been shortened to about 0.15-0.2 meters. You can get closer to the subject during shooting, and take small objects larger to achieve a macro-like effect. Coupled with the natural perspective of the 50\u00a0mm standard lens, it can provide an effect close to the human visual experience, which is very suitable for shooting food, snacks, small objects and commodities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause it is designed to be your most frequently used lens, we made it compact. Now you can enjoy advanced optical performance in a compact size \u00a0with a total length of only about 119 mm \uff084.7in\uff09and a weight of only about \u00a0360g. It is good to take it with you when you go out, or hold it for a long time, which contributes to the stability of shooting. Making it easier to use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeeChan\u00a0allowing videographers to make smooth aperture changes while retaining traditional aperture stop for stills photographers. The manual focus ring is incredibly smooth and perfectly damped, allowing for smooth and accurate focus results across the 180 degrees of focus travel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to solve the mechanical challenge of the precise bayonet interface with the space constraints around the iPhone camera. YeeChan employs a threaded connection for a firm, easy to use the connection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Moisture-Resistant and dust-proof structure is adopted, and the bayonet, focus ring, switch panel and switch of the lens are sealed to improve the reliability of the lens. In addition, by improving the strength of the lens barrel and redesigning the structure of the part connection, a highly robust lens body structure is realized without increasing the weight as much as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeeChan compatible with iPhone X and above and Samsung Galaxy S10/S10+ /S20/ S20+.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe YeeChan lens projects the image upside down. For this reason, we recommend using a third-party app to flip the image back to the normal orientation, such as FiLMiC Pro (Video - iOS and Android), ProCamera (Photo and Video - iOS), Filmakr (Video - iOS), MAVIS (Video - iOS), ProMovie (Video - iOS), Camera 645 Pro Mk 3 (Photo and Video - iOS) or Open Camera (Photo/Video - Android).\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also use the YeeChan in your smartphone\u2019s stock/native camera app with the image flipped upside down if you prefer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "Text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning is a workout that uses all of the major muscles of our body and develops our physical and mental fitness. People have always believed that going on long, intense runs would upgrade their physical abilities. But, intense/ exhausting workouts only tire our muscles and diminishes our passion for working out.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are times when we cannot figure out if our workouts are effectively done the right way. If we choose to leave it to our instincts to decide, our physical health might be at risk. And we would need to empty our pockets to check our bodies with professional medical equipment. Now, this is why we need a smart fitness device at times.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the current fitness devices sold in the market can only calculate our heart rates and burnt calories. The fitness devices we usually attach to our arms or wrists cannot accurately calculate our activity levels as if they were to be attached to our thighs. (As thighs are where the actual active muscles are located). So we fully developed and applied the world's first muscle oxygen saturation calculating technology by attaching the devices to our thighs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevices utilizing oxygen saturation levels were initially made for athletes. Still, we wanted to provide the general public access to a workout solution in a more convenient, simple, and professional way.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs REPACE was developed after over 8 years of research, REPACE not only measures the muscle oxygen saturation levels. But, it can provide the users with a personalized running plan based on scientific algorithms and data.\n\n\n\n\n\nStop running your longest and fastest miles. With REPACE, get your workout solution to fit your endurance and health levels based on scientific algorithms and data. You will be able to feel the change in your performance like a professional athlete.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeel Like Heart Rate Checks are Not Enough for Your Fitness?\nWant to Prove the Science Behind Working Out?\nWant to See Proper/ Time Efficient Workout Results?\nNeed the Most Effective Workout Solution Based on Your Target?\nNeed some Motivation for Your Workout?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeeky Gadgets\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngadgetgram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo measure the lactate threshold, runners needed special equipment, sports medicine experts, additional expenses, and must visit specific facilities. (And draw blood)\n\n\n\n\n\nBut just with REPACE, it can all be done. Just simply fasten it on your thighs, and the users can measure their lactate threshold without having to draw blood and comprehensively analyze their current workout performance capacities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe realized that our workout performance tests and simple heartbeat monitoring were not enough. With REPACE's very own technological advancements, we developed an algorithm to make constant adjustments to provide more effective workout solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the LT TEST, REPACE will provide you with the workout instructions in 3 different types based on individual workout levels and purposes.\n\n\n\nFat Oxidation (In Development)\n\n\nREPACE is more than just a simple running/ testing/ analyzing app. It can measure and provide a workout solution based on its previous records.\n\n\n\n\n\nREPACE is the world's first workout solution program providing an objective scientific way of working out. We will constantly develop REPACE to support Cycling, Mountain Climbing, and even strength trainings like Pilates and Weight Training based on our backers' feedback and internal system upgrades.\n\n\n\n\n\nStart working out according to your physical condition and choosing the appropriate workout intensity. You will become more fit and healthy through running.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0It is not easy for us to objectively figure out if we are working out the right way at the moment. But REPACE monitors the users' workout sessions in real-time. Based on this data, it provides vocal coaching guides to work out with.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe compelling voice guides allow (to assist runners in reaching their goals) users to run at a steady speed to upgrade their physical abilities and motivate them to keep running.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the application of the BLE 5.0 technology, REPACE can save its collected data on to the application without any transmission errors. REPACE also allows users to instantly visualize their upgrading/degrading workout capacities by providing daily, monthly, and yearly statistical reports.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe more you use REPACE, your workout skills will elevate, and you will always have your flawless personal trainer by your side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe all know that your favorite workouts will burn you out someday. So REPACE rewards the users with medals each time they workout to provide them a sense of new accomplishments. We are planned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt would feel nice to enhance our physical fitness but, wouldn't it be more exciting to find someone to workout together? You might motivate someone around you and partner up and join you! Start sharing your workout history with your friends on Facebook.\nCurrently, REPACE is only equipped with the Facebook Friends system. More extra features and upgrades will be carried out based on our backers' feedback. Our lab will take a step further in our journey from our backers' growing love and interest in REPACE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREPACE measured the user's muscle oxygen saturation levels through functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). By tightening the device onto the user's thighs it can calculate the oxygen saturation levels (SmO2) and calculation\n\n\n\n\n\nREPACE automatically calculates the adequate workout duration and intensity through its application. Suppose REPACE is attached at a certain spot on your thighs. In that case, it can more accurately measure the exhaustion levels of your muscles. Check your fluctuating muscle oxygen saturation levels yourself.\n\n\n\nWhen checking on your SmO2, REPACE will reverse track the 2mmol/L and 4mmol/L Blood Lactate levels & provide a workout solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* When using REPACE outdoors, the users can check their running routes via a cellphone GPS. Users can also work out however they want, not following the workout solutions, and REPACE will check their SmO2 in real-time.\u00a0\n** REPACE is also pairable with an Apple Watch heart rate tracker and can check the users' heart rates in real-time as well.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor accurate testing and a steady fixation, you would need to use the appropriate thigh bands. After the campaign successfully comes to a close, we will send out a survey for backers to receive the correctly-sized bands.\n\n\n\n\n\nSit yourself down, place your legs on a chair, and measure the circumference of your thighs located 5 inches above your knee cap. This would be the adequate thigh band size to order when filling out the survey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Kickstarter Pledges Only:\nWe will provide an extra band for our backers! (Total of 2/ size mix & match available \u2b55)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOBELAB is a company initially started in the science lab of KAIST. NIRSIT is a portable device that could measure our brain's oxygen saturation levels with our very on fNIRS technology.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nOur expertise in our self-developed technology has been verified by the relative academia and industry. With our own technologies like these, we developed REPACE to upgrade our users' physical capacities. So, we would like to offer our backers the world's first hands-on experience on our device.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter our Kickstarter campaign, we are planning to develop an algorithm to calculate the ratio of how many carbs/ fats are burnt while working out, based on our backers' feedback. (est. 2nd half of 2022). We genuinely hope to find the path to develop alongside our backers.\n\n\n\n\n\nOBELAB has developed and manufactured healthcare devices since 2013 and has been safety-approved with different certifications. Our self-developed technology has been developed by cooperating with the nation's top medical schools' algorithms and clinical trials to fully develop a complete device.\n\nThe tests were carried out with the nation's expert medical school in sports medicine. They cooperated in academic and scientific certification and collaboration. REPACE is the first device for individual use (not for labs or hospitals). It will be the case where brain science technology has been applied to sports science. We are delighted to present REPACE to our backers, developed with our most extraordinary expertise and efforts. And we will try our best not to leave our backers to stay disappointed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project is boosted by BackerCrew"

        "Text": "\n3D Printed Oxygen-ABS powered Rocket\u00a0Engine\n\u00a0First of all, I would like to mention that we are building a prototype that is not intended for sale.\n\n\n\n\n\nHello, and welcome to our project.\nWe are Moritz, Amelia and Vincent from Landshut in Germany\nand are currently studying at the Hans-Leinberger-Gymnasium Landshut.\nThe idea for our project started with a class competition in our school: The task was to build a small car. The others in the class spent a lot of money on mini car kits on the internet, but we had an idea.\nWhy not 3D print a drive? It's cheaper, smaller, and stronger. So we made a 3D model and printed it ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0After we printed the rocket, the first test phase started:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe fixed the rocket on a vice and connected it to a bag with pure oxygen. we used a sparkler to light it, then we squeezed the bag with oxygen so that the oxygen flows through the rocket. We found that the exhaust did not come out with a lot of pressure and that most of the rocket's \u00a0ABS was not burned. So we printed a new model with a smaller opening and an interior with high combustion efficiency.\nSecond test phase:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the second test phase was quite successful, we test the flammability of two ABS parts printed in different ways. The part on the left of the video is the outer skin of the rocket the part on the right is made of the same material, just printed differently in order to burn perfectly in the interior of our rocket.\nThird test phase:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the next step we exchanged the oxygen bag for an oxygen bottle with 10 bar air pressure to find out whether the pressure of the oxygen plays a role.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough the test, we learned that more pressure is more thrust. The next step is the exact force measurement. In order to remove the human factor from the equation, we have to be able to precisely control the oxygen supply and this cannot be implemented with an oxygen cylinder. So we developed a concept to release the oxygen in a controlled manner: A kind of press that compresses a bag of oxygen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe model is not yet equipped with technology because it is still a small pre-print. For the problem that comes up now, we need your support: In order to supply a test-ready amount of oxygen, a larger press is required, and we are not able to pay for the technology for this ourselves. We also need a larger and more precise 3D printer in order to develop more complex rockets and the press in the future. We will also make a metal shell for the rocket, which will enable us to exchange the rocket after use and to recycle it to make new rockets from it.\nPersonal words:\nWith our project we want to build a prototype. In addition, with this project we are taking part in a German youth research competition, which gives us better chances of getting a renumed university place if we get a good placement.\nWe hope you like our project :)\nAll the best,\nMoritz, Ameila and Vincent\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "Text": "Hi everyone! My name is Mihai and I am a software developer who wants to create useful things that add value to people's lives. In the past, I created Fakey (https://fakey.osome.iu.edu/) which is a media literacy fake-news game that has gotten some attention. I also built a lot of other creations in the goal-tracking and automation space which you can find on my website (https://mihaisplace.com)\n\nThe problem?\nEarlier this year I wanted to buy a new gaming console, and to my chagrin, every time I saw releases being hyped in the news, I was always too late to buy it as it went out of stock very quickly. This was a major pain point for me and I had a vision that this process should be much simpler. A person should be texted as soon as an item is back in stock so that they can increase their chances of buying it. This is how the idea for the Item Tracker was born with the notion of creating a software tool that can ping us as soon as something we are seeking is back in stock.\u00a0\n\nWhy solve this problem now?\u00a0\nWith the onset of the global pandemic and international supply chains struggling, it has been difficult to get some items that we seek which have been out-of-stock or heavily backlogged. Some clear examples of this that always surface in the news involve the next-gen console shortages where it has been incredibly difficult to buy new PS5s, Xbox Series Xs, and GPUs. I also believe this situation will only get worse as supply chains will further get strained as we use up our planet's supply of raw materials.\n\nWhat have I built so far?\nCurrently, the software I built involves sites where someone can subscribe to the new PS5 and Xbox Series S/X. If someone subscribes, they will get a text to the phone number they provide as soon as the console comes back in stock in any stores. With just a few small private and public launches in the last couple of months, these sites have seen hundreds of users, and dozens of subscribers. I can see that there is some value here and it is solving a problem, which is something I am very happy with.\n\nHere is how the sites look below\n\n\n\nTracker Service for the Xbox Series S/X\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracker Service for the PS5\n\n\n\nThe ask?\nRight now I am providing the service for free and it costs me about $100/mo. to upkeep the servers and technology that can enable the service to work. This will likely not be sustainable for me for long unless I have some funding to justify continuing the service. What's more is that in the future I would like to expand this service to include the new Nintendo OLED, different types of GPUs, trading cards, clothes, and any other supplies that will fall into this category of items that are highly sought after, for which there is very low supply. After building the basic functionality for these services, I would like to create a tool that can help broker a place in line for people who are wanting to buy something of low supply. This way, if someone wants to buy a new item, they can simply pre-fill a request to buy and it will be purchased automatically on their behalf - completely automating the process and removing the burden of having the person vying for a slot to purchase it themselves. Finally, I plan to create a wiki with tips on how people can boost their chances of buying various items they seek that are in low supply.\n\nHere is the timeline for the product\n- Tracker service for the Nintendo OLED and popular GPUs (1 - 2 months)\n- Item tracker tips wiki (1 - 2 months)\n- Tracker service for other sought after items coming from user interviews (3 - 6 months)\n- Fully automated item purchaser service (6 - 12 months)\n- Improving the services to be as quick, fair, and secure as possible (1 - 2 years)\n\nIn conclusion,\nI hope you consider working alongside me on this product. You can see from the Rewards section that I plan to build alongside all of you and really help you drive the effort or features via 1 on 1 conversation and focus groups. I am simply here to serve and solve your problems in getting the items you seek. Finally, I will share all the details of the process and adopt a mindset of building in the open with transparency in mind.\u00a0\n\nThank you for reading this far if you have, hope you have a great day regardless of whether you fund this project!\n\nWarm regards,\n~ Mihai"

We always wanted to create something from scratch, so we met online during the 2021 Covid lockdown, and \u00a0started working on this project. We met then in real life and became good friends and co-workers.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are prototyping a pair of shoes with two electric motors and four wheels with detachable shafts. The product will include both the electronic/ tech part and the footwear, attached one on the top of the other. \u00a0\n\nTalking about tech things, we designed it with two electric motors that give high speed and high torque, in order to reach 12 kph or 7.5 mph. Each shoe will have a battery under the center of the foot, the transmission, and two detachable shafts that connect to the four wheels. You will be able to control the speed thanks to the pressure sensors put inside the sole.\n\nOne of our goals is to make this product easy and comfy to wear everywhere, so we studied the detachable shafts that permit you to use the Sheels also indoors.\u00a0\nFor example, in many places like schools or offices, you can't wear rollers skates and you must have a pair of common shoes to use there, so you need a place to put the skates when you are not using them. With this product you will forget these problems; once you enter into a structure you can remove the wheels, and put them back when you leave. Another of our goals, that we will reach with experience of prototyping, is to make a foldable, but stable, sole that will help you in the step.\n\n\n\n\nThe case for the working model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplay model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3D printed electric motor's case\n\n\nOn the aesthetic appearance, is our goal on the final product to make every pair unique. We are currently designing a lot of customizable parts that will integrate a basic model. You will be able to choose between different options of led lights designs, colors, the lateral bumpers, the designs of the wheels, and much more. We are doing this because we want the user to find an identity in this product and stand out.\n\n\n\n\nHere's an artwork of the concept\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0We want to share with the people our idea of freedom of spirit. Many times happens in the commuting life that the trip becomes just \"necessary\"; we start seeing it as a boring thing we have to do to reach our destination. We died of boredom from this for years, \u00a0so we asked ourselves what could change this everyday routine. \u00a0We wanted to create real emotions that could help people live better the day. \u00a0Something that was more than a simple pair of shoes; something that could give speed, fun, and excitement. Imagine a life where you can move around at a certain speed with just your feet, \u00a0feeling free from all the things that stress you, and reach your destination with a free spirit and ready to start. How would it be?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0We are currently designing our first prototype, and very soon we will 3d print it; this will help us to give a representative shape of the product and will become the display model. At the same time, we are building the first working prototype, with actual motors, battery, controls, and wheels. For this one, we are using a simple shoe bought in a shop and the case will be printed again in plastic. \u00a0For the component, we already invested money, and every time we want to develop we have to use more.\n\n\u00a0As the project rises, also expenses do. To obtain the best result possible we need the best materials and the best components. We want to keep the product the lightest possible for perfect use, to do that we need a carbon fiber case for example, but also the electronics must take less space, and also the battery could be more powerful with less weight. \u00a0So we are doing a campaign on Kickstarter to make something unique, perfect and create a community with which we can connect and share our passion for this product.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe want to pursue our dream and goal to create something good and fun for people. We can see the potential of this product to unite and make people share time together. Thanks to the speed, people will be able to race, make obstacle courses, and go downtown or to skateparks together. We imagine groups of friends sharing times to choose their perfect customization of a pair of Sheels, or also family members designing together their most liked style. We all know after Covid, how important and precious is the time spent with the people that make us feel good, so we want to give opportunities to have something to share with the people we love the most.\n\n\u00a0Contacts and social media:\nHere's our Instagram to follow the progress: @hercurymotion\u00a0\nFor more infos please contact: hercury.company@gmail.com\u00a0"

        "Text": "Now, you can say goodbye to blindly maintaining the cleanliness of your mouth. With the introduction of the SUNUO water flosser, you can clean each individual tooth with precision. Featuring a 5MP camera with a 360\u00b0 field of view, no plaque, particles, or grime will escape your sight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaintaining oral care is essential for your overall health and wellbeing. With the SUNUO, completing this task has never been easier. No matter where you are, SUNUO will take care of all your dental cleaning needs. With a 180 ml water tank, high pressure water flow, and dual 200-280nm wavelength UV sterilizers, you can be assured that your mouth will stay fresh and clean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Enter the SUNUO, the all-in-one water flosser. You can say goodbye to the difficulties of brushing your teeth and flossing. With this device, cleaning between your teeth has never been easier. No longer do you have to carry around floss in your bag, now, all you need is the SUNUO and some water and you are good to go.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether it be at a party, on a date, or at work, due to the portable, compact nature of the SUNUO, you can always keep your teeth clean and healthy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SUNUO is a big step up from traditional flossing and other modern water flossers. Equipped with a 5MP camera, 6 LED lights and a wifi connected app, we provide an experience like no other.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you are using the flosser, you will be able to clearly see every area that needs cleaning. With some smart technology and programming, none of your problem areas will be left untouched. Braces, for example, are no match for the pulsating water stream of the SUNUO.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can control the SUNUO Intelligent Visual Water Flosser in our App.\n\u00a03 different camera modes\n\n\n\n\n\nWater flow pressure adjustmen\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose water flossing mode and turn the SUNUO on\n\n\n\n\n\nMoreover, you can choose to take pictures in black and white or color, as well as flip the images.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can download the proprietary app via QR code or the link on the instructions. Once you download it, choose your language and begin the best water flossing experience of your life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeaturing a water pressure which can reach around 140 PSI, SUNUO produces a thin, precise water stream. Unlike other water flossers, ours pulsates the water stream at around 1600 pulsations per minute. This helps to effectively remove any food particles that may be stuck, or dental plaque that\u2019s usually difficult to clean.\n\n\n\n\n\nDriving the water flow is a frictionless pump. The settings of the water pressure can be adjusted to fit the needs of your individual mouth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a tool that will touch the inside of your mouth, it is important to maintain cleanliness. The SUNUO uses UV sterilizers, one is for sanitizing and cleaning the nozzle, the other one is for sanitizing and preventing bacterial growth. Through this redundant system, there is no way for bacteria to remain, thus keeping your mouth safe and healthy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SUNUO is equipped with 3 different nozzles, which aims for satisfying the needs of anyone who may use our product.\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard nozzle: For daily cleaning and oral care\nPeriodontal nozzle: For cleaning the gums. A soft and narrow nozzle\n\n\n\n\n\nOrthodontic nozzle: For those with braces. Since there are more gaps and dead angles around braces, it is hard to clean properly with a toothbrush. The orthodontics nozzle is professionally designed with narrow and tiny brushes.\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Pressure Modes: gentle, standard, and spa modes are supported, allowing you to choose a suitable water pressure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe design of the SUNUO brilliantly hides its nozzle. You only need to gently pull out the nozzle to use it. This keeps the nozzle tucked away for hygienic purposes, as well as for more compact storage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the main features of the SUNUO is the large 180 ml water tank. The reason we can make the capacity so large is due to the collapsible nature of it. When in storage mode, the water tank won\u2019t take up any extra space in your purse or bag. When you need to rinse your teeth, just pull on the water tank, fill it up, and rinse away.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe want to give you the freedom to choose how to clean your mouth, so we\u2019ve also added the option to use mouthwash instead of water.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SUNUO comes with a 2000mAh battery. This amount of power is enough to use for 50 minutes at one time. No matter if it's a wall adapter, PC, laptop, or \u00a0power bank, you always have an option to keep your SUNUO fully charged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe waterproofing level is IPX7, so you can use it while washing your face or taking a shower.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0The SUNUO team is dedicated to improving oral hygiene and maintaining cleanliness. We believe and support healthy habits and lifestyles. We\u2019ve turned our passion for cleaning products into cleaning of teeth and gums. This product turns out to be easy to use, comfortable and most important of all, an effective solution to maintain your oral hygiene. Therefore, in terms of product design, the inventing process, or the choices for accessories, we have maintained a very strict standard throughout the whole process. We\u2019ve worked really hard to bring better products to our customers.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ1: What are the causes of itching or gum bleeding?\nA1: You might bleed because your gums are not used to this high water pressure, your gums are weak, or you have periodontal disease. However, if it hasn\u2019t stopped after one week or you still feel pain, please consult your dentist.\n\nQ2: What is the suggested mode for a beginner?\nA2: We suggest you use the soft mode for the first time.\n\nQ3:After using the water flosser, do I still need to brush my teeth?\nA3: Our water flosser is not a substitute for a toothbrush. On one hand, a toothbrush can clean out most of the plaque on the surface. On the other hand, the water flosser is mainly used for cleaning the dead angles and blind sides where a toothbrush cannot properly reach. So, this product is complementary to the toothbrush.\n\nQ4:Will the water stream hurt my gums if the water pressure is strong?\nA4: The SUNUO Intelligent Visual Water Flosser uses pulsating pressure technology, which creates a soft water stream and ensures cleaning effectiveness. When used properly, it won\u2019t hurt your gums.\n\nQ5:How can I replace the nozzle?\nA5: You can simply loosen it like a screw and it should come right off.\n\nQ6:Why can't I turn it off right away after usage?\nA6: The pump will activate sleep mode every 2 minutes while not in use. The light signals will be off. If there is no connection for Wi-Fi, the camera and Wi-Fi signal light will be turned off after 2 minutes.\n\nQ7:When I use it, does it make any noise?\nA7: When in use, some noise will be generated and will stay within the 70dB range.\n\nQ8:Should I only use cold water?\nA8: You should use water lower than 38\u00b0C (100\u00b0F).\n\nQ9:How can I properly operate the water flosser?\nA9: Hold the water flosser upright and extend the nozzle into your mouth, aiming for gaps or gums. Clean along the teeth, slowly and sequentially."

For this reason you never lose any password even in the case of device destruction.\nWhen you compose a specific Key Pad sequence, you will obtain the same password every time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe masked password is Secure Key\u2019s proprietary technology which allows you to protect your real password. How? It's simple.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou simply type a short numeric sequence into the keypad (called a masked password) and Secure Key will generate the corresponding, unique complex password.\nFor example, if the \"masked password\" for your Facebook account is \"A12\", your Secure Key will generate a complex password when you dial \"A12\".\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this is where the magic happens! If someone steals your masked password and dials \"A12\" on his or her Secure Key, the password will be totally different, as each device generates a different password with the same \"masked password\". This means that you are still safe, even if someone has access to your masked password file.\n\n\"The best way to protect your passwords is to always have access to them without ever saving or storing them anywhere.\"\nThat's exactly what SecureKey allows you to do.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many cases of stolen passwords causing enormous trouble and damage.\nThis happens often as we save online many important things online. Frequently we protect our entire online life with the same simple password for convenience.\nSecureKey helps you to avoid this mistake, providing a service that allows you to use strong and secure passwords in an easy and fast way. In a few seconds you will create your password without having to remember or store it anywhere.\n\n\nSecurekey is ideal for personal use\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nProtect your privacy and accounts including:\n\nPersonal data\nBank accounts\nCrypto wallets\nGoogle drive account\nSocial accounts (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Linkedin...)\nPhoto, Video.......All the important things in your life which you don't want other people to access\n\n\nFollow the Secure Key guidelines to avoid identity or data theft.\n\n\nAs well as for professional use\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use Secure Key in your daily job to:\n\nProtect your customers' accounts and data\nHelp your company with compliancy and high security standards\nStore your professional passwords\nSave time on storing and finding passwords\nGuarantee a better service for your customers and colleagues\n\n\n\nALWAYS WITH YOU\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nSecureKey uses the highest quality materials to ensure it can withstand the wear and tear of long trips or a typical day. Securekey's aluminum case makes it both robust and durable. It doesn't use batteries to operate and powers up at the moment you plug it into your device meaning it will never be out of power.\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck the video to see how to access your pc in a safe and fast way with Secure Key.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBOX:\nMaterial: Aluminum Anodized\nDimension x,y,z: 77,5 mm x 84,6 mm x 16 mm\nWeight: 40 gr\n\u200bUSB:\nType: Micro-USB\nInterface: Magnetic\nLenght: 1 mt\n\u200bKEYPAD:\nMaterial: Plastic\nType: Membrane\nFeedback: Vibration\nCOMPATIBILITY:\nPC and MAC with USA UK IT DE ESP Keyboard impostation.\nDevices (smartphone and tablet) only with OS Android with USB Type-C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "Text": "\n\n\n\n\nTWS earphones. Familiar names, boxy looks, and the old-fashioned popping-hood design. It\u2019s the golden formula of mediocrity. We are here to re-write the formula. You want all the features, we give them all, plus a design from the future.\nWe are talking deep here. Earphones from the future aren\u2019t just limited by the looks, but the open-casing that makes wearing the earphone in just 1 second; the half-in-ear design yet active noise cancellation; the LDAC codec that plays CD-level quality music into your ear and finally, the combination of space aluminum material and Anti-Glare glass that packs every wonder into small and streamline-shaped TWS \u00a0earphones\n\n\n\n\n\nWe combine creative design, sublime comfort, and unparalleled audio performance together, \u00a0making X-BOAT PRO quite different from other TWS earphones.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nPopping the hood is normal for earphones. But why bother when you don\u2019t have to?\nWith an open-casing design, we eliminated the drop-top hood. Taking the headphone is just a slide away instead of case-opening and buds fumbling. Enjoying music is only one slide-to-unlock away.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a single-hand operation mechanism, you can wear earphones with ease in any busy-hand environment like taking the subway, working, shopping, phone calls.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nEasy to use does not mean easy to drop. With integrated magnets, the earphones stay light but firm in the case. Light tipping or 180\u00b0 flipping, this pair is staying.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the open-casing design, you will never have to pop the hood to check that if you are bringing both earphones or not. Everything is in a glimpse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's easy to find ANC earphones these days---when they were full-in-ear ones. There\u2019s nothing wrong with such a design, except when you put them on for a long time, the shape starts to block the ear canal, adding unnecessary pressure. We took a harder yet different approach, the half-in-ear solution.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nX-BOAT PRO combines the most advanced ANC algorithm and large drivers to bring you a new listening experience from true wireless audio. This means you can hear less noise and more music playing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe earphones are ergonomically molded to precisely fit your ear. \u00a0It's just 3.9g each, offering a weightless way and more comfortable wearing experience even after long hours of use - Survivor of the fittest, winner of the quietest.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy X-BOAT PRO can deliver CD Audio quality. We know you can\u2019t hear now. But data will tell you\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most common audio codec for earphones is the SBC codec, with which the maximum sample bit-rate is still lossy 320 Kbps. \u00a0With LDAC, your Bluetooth audio device can now transfer up to 3x the data consistently compared to SBC---in short, you can enjoy non-stop 100% CD audio quality on your X-BOAT PRO.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe large 13 mm LCP dynamic driver inside each earphone delivers bass you can feel in your bone. lets you experience the soaring melodies and rich timbres of all your favorite tunes.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlus, the Integrated Class AB Hi-Fi amplifier can bring optimal audio performance and power efficiency.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWe built the charging case of X-BOAT PRO under the same material as a phone. The touch feeling is quite different from other TWS earphones.\nWith CNC, we get to carve the shape out as one perfect piece of metal with zero gaps. The Anti-glare Glass processing adds one extra layer of texture that leaves no fingerprints but millions of colors under the sun.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a built-in Airoha 5.2 chip, X-BOAT PRO is able to adapt smarter power management during the playing process, achieving a stunning 40-hour playback time. You might forget to charge it quite often simply because you don't need to. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nPlus, You can plug the X-BOAT PRO into your phone (Type-C port) for charging. Connect the headphones for just 20 minutes, and you can expect the X-BOAT PRO to run an additional 5 hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0With long battery life, you can keep X-BOAT PRO everywhere with you. Never worried run out of juice while on the go.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign Story \u00a0\nLotus awaiting for blossom is, in our eyes, the perfect combination of body curve and visual lightness. The design of XBOAT PRO chased our fantasy for such beauty with its unique earphone holster structure and 100% stream-lined shape. The charging bay of Xboat is largely covered in aluminum with meticulous machining of 5-axis CNC to mimic the shape of nature, while the ever-glowing color flying through your eyes. The design was a huge challenge. Not only did we have to get the shape right, but also we must adjust the sizing of earphones for both charging bay and ear fitting.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nCharging case crafted by CNC\n\n\nIn terms of sound quality, we managed to level up the game even higher: we chose LCP dynamic driver instead of titanium diaphragm driver for better sound quality and, later, we built a connection with SONY officials for a product review. They eventually gave permission to authorize the LDAC codecs to X-boat Pro for its overall performance.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe outcome of all the efforts costs more to make the product but also gives a better user experience to customers. Our vision is to build a set of people\u2019s earphones with supreme music performance while looking good when putting it on. With the front side representing the future, the back pays tribute to the past. The Anti-glare glass with PET filming cast a mist to create a mystical contrast between itself and the shining body, like a sexy creation from Hajime Sorayama in a modern mask, blending the sci-fi past of industrial design to a flattened, more simplified future. On top of visual language, we also tried very hard in making a perfect front chamber---like twenty times iteration hard---to achieve absolute comforts when you put the earphone on, and the smooth feeling when you slide the earphones in or out of the charging bay. As for the earphone, we chose vacuum plating + skin-like coating to make it feel elegant, look sharp, yet keep stealthy when in use. Xboat is our attempt to express technological beauty with nature language---metals are cold, but humanity isn\u2019t.\nAbout Us\nSpending years of time in the earphone business taught us a tough fact: from concept with exceptional design to production-ready stands a wall of sacrifice lists for higher efficiency and yield rate. By the time customers got their hands on the actual product, what they see would become a bland, mediocre product lacking beauty or basic user experience. YOBYBO wasn\u2019t born to be this way. Our goal is to give birth to a design that follows our hearts from the very beginning. Instead of simplifying the process for the industry, we chose to keep the precious creative design as it intended to be, no matter how much harder it would be to build. The product we built is the mirror of our vision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe higher our guidelines would be, the more procedures we had to go through. We set up more product inspections for a more reliable industrial renovation to make sure our products meet the global standard for a good one. If we had to choose between the cost and quality, we would definitely go to the latter one.\nWe were the creators of the world\u2019s thinnest TWS earphones---CARD20, which won the Reddot and iF design award of 2020. Our push-to-unlock NOTE20 won the Reddot design award as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe reviewed our entire streamline of the production of these two products: from concept to engineering, development, till the final manufacturing. All the problems were put under the telescope for improvements of our next-gen product.\nNow here we are with X-boat Pro. A better statement for a better time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 2,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $900M raised between them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This means that the only area where vital signs can be reliably measured remains the face.\nSo, we developed Oxama with a patent pending technology to be worn on the face for two main reasons:\u00a0\n\nOxama is designed to measure the PPG signal directly on facial blood vessels that are much less affected by low perfusion or movement artifacts, allowing for very reliable blood oxygen saturation and heart rate measurements even during deep dives.\nThe best location of a sound exciter to be heard is obviously closed to ears and in particular in contact with the skull: the sound propagates just through your bones and tissue and is directly perceived by your eardrums.\n\nFor this reasons OXAMA\u00a0has been designed to fit into your diving mask or under your diving goggles in comfortable contact with your face.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nHow comfortable is Oxama?\nWe tested OXAMA on many subjects, female and male, with different ages. We found that, depending on the subject face shape, OXAMA is very comfortable with several underwater diving and freediving masks for each subject and in some subject with all the tested masks. All subjects reported no water leakage and no impact on visibility \u00a0during the immersion.\u00a0 Moreover, OXAMA can be used also without a diving mask, being compatible with many types of diving googles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Which parameters does OXAMA track?\u00a0\nOXAMA tracks your performance\u00a0recording both biometric and environmental parameters, and reproduces them with an adjustable voice assistant.\n\n\n\nBiometric and Environmental parameters recorded by OXAMA device\n\n\n\n\u00a0Blood oxygen saturation: it is a relative measure of the concentration of oxygen \u00a0dissolved or carried in the blood as a proportion of the maximal concentration that can be dissolved in the blood (%).\n\u00a0Heart rate: it is the speed of the heartbeat measured by the number of contractions (beats) of the heart per minute (bpm)\n\u00a0Time: it is the measure of the duration of the dive time (s)\n\u00a0Ascending / Descending Speed: measure of the speed during the diving ascent / descent (m/s)\n\u00a0Acceleration: it is the measure of the acceleration during the dive(m2/s)\n\u00a0Temperature: it is the measure of the water temperature (\u00b0C)\n\u00a0Depth: it is the measure of the real-time or max depth during dive time (m)\n\u00a0Head angle : it represents the measure of the head orientation with respect to the horizon for the posture control (degrees)\n\n\nWhy is it important to track the Blood oxygen saturation and heart beat rate during the dive?\n\ncustom recovery time estimate based on recorded values\ncorrelation between performance and biometric parameters during training . By looking at the data during training, divers could learn how to extend their dive time, how to stay calm and focus better, and thus reduce their body\u2019s draw on its limited oxygen supplies.\ngreater awareness of your own health conditions\n\n\nOXAMA speaks to you!\nYou don\u2019t need to read any display, stay focused on your immersion!\nOXAMA informs in real-time on measured parameters. OXAMA uses with the most non-stressing and natural way possible to communicate to the diver: a quiet human voice clearly heard directly in your head thanks to a sophisticated bones transducer that converts the audio messages into sound mechanical waves through the skull. Language, level of detail, thresholds and frequency of all \u00a0vocal messages can be simply defined by the user through the smartphone OXAMA app.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe four OXAMA voice modes\n\n\n\u00a0You can set OXAMA on different voice modes, as you prefer.\u00a0You decide the parameters and the the moment in which you want to listen their values as the following voice modes:\u00a0\n\n\u00a0MUTE: OXAMA records all the parameters during dive time but doesn't speak to you\n\u00a0QUIET: OXAMA records all the parameters during dive time and speaks to you \u00a0at the beginning and at the end of the immersion\n\u00a0ALERT : OXAMA records all the parameters during dive time and speaks to you only for the thresholds programmed by you.\n\u00a0CHATTY: OXAMA records all the parameters during dive time and speaks to you both for the thresholds and every 15 seconds for all the parameters programmed by you\u00a0.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhich problems does OXAMA solve?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nTogether with many other freedivers, we found that classic wrist computer are hard to be read during freediving immersion, and moreover, they do not offer information about the diver's health conditions (for example blood oxygen saturation and heart rate). \u00a0The solution introduced by OXAMA is a vocal assistant that provide to you both environmental and biometric data. So you can stay focused on the immersion and improve your performance.\n\n\n\nThe problems that Oxama solves: diving computer are often hard to read (left) and don't offer information about the diver's health (right)\n\n\nWhich freediving disciplines are managed?\u00a0\nOXAMA is able to manage pre-set programs for static, dynamic, deep immersion freediving and spearfishing with dedicated diving parameters and different behavior for each discipline. Each program can be personalized by setting which parameters are communicated, with which frequency or threshold value for each parameter.\n\n\n\nFreediving disciplines managed by OXAMA device\n\n\nYou could be interested in exploring your biometric parameters like heart rate (HR) and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) during for example a static workout session, so you will be surprised to visualize your mammalian diving reflex or your SpO2 recovery rate. \u00a0\n\n\n\nHR and SpO2 measure during a static workout session.\n\n\nOr for example you can track your head angle during a dynamic workout session in order to improve your diving posture to reach the optimal hydrodynamics.\n\n\n\nSpO2 and Head Posture Angle during a dynamic workout session.\n\n\nAnd finally you will track not only the classic depth parameter, but also the descending and ascending speed during a deep dive in order to take under control the energy and oxygen consumption.\n\n\n\nDepth and descending/ascending speed during a deep or a spearfishing session.\n\n\nSo ... Who is OXAMA for?\u00a0\nOXAMA for the beginner. \u00a0A virtual coach always with you!

There\u2019s nothing better than friendly competition to keep you motivated. \u00a0\n\n\n\nThe Oxama app\n\n\nWhy was OXAMA born?\nOXAMA was born under water, from the need of three freedivers (Vincenzo, Massimo, Claudio) eager to know their vital parameters during freediving and consequently to improve their performances on the basis of measured and analyzed data. The path has been long and we need the help and support from all the freedivers community !\n\nWhere does OXAMA name come from?\nThe OXAMA name comes from OX, short for oximetry, and AMA, the traditional Japanese women divers famous for collecting pearls.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nJapanese ama pearl diver\n\n\n\u00a0Which are the components OXAMA is made of?\u00a0\nBiometric sensor. A non-invasive optical 4-wavelength photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor measures heart rate and blood oxygen saturation continuously during the immersions, the two most important parameters to track the health conditions and to improve the safety and the performances of the diver. The measurements are collected directly on the face of the diver to overcome the issue of arm and finger low blood perfusion in deep immersions.\nEnvironmental sensors. A digital high precision pressure sensor measures depth and temperature, while a digital 3 axis accelerometer sensor measures acceleration and the head spatial \u00a0orientation. Based on data collected by sensors, many useful parameters are calculated: depth, ascending and descending speed, head XYZ posture angle and acceleration.\nVocal assistant.

        "Text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMofit is an attachable smart light you can easily attach and detach to the helmet. Children who are not proficient with riding a bike can simply tilt their heads to make turning signals. Also, in a case of emergency or danger, Mofit sends the location of the children to the parents through the connected app. Mofit notifies and allows parents to make fast action in the case of accident and will always protect the safety of the children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMofit is designed to be attachable to the helmet children always wear. The simple and light design prevents discomfort when attached and also provides a clean look. It can also be attached to the parent\u2019s helmet; thus, the whole family can use it together.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of just the helmet, Mofit can be attached to the bike or a kickboard as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChildren may not be familiar with riding a bike, so there are many cases where they lose control and fall down while riding when they try to signal a turn using a hand. However, Mofit provides a solution to this problem by allowing a turn signal by just tilting the head to the turning direction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo problem even if an accident occurs! Mofit, connected to the app, will notify the parents if the children are immobile for a set period. The location is sent right away to the parents allowing a fast action from the parents and preventing more problematic situations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bluetooth connected Mofit allows the parent in lead to make a turn signal and send the identical signal to the children in the back. This allows much safer riding since the children can simply recognize the signal and follow the lead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe character in the Mofit app recognizes the rider\u2019s movement and provides various quests and items you can collect to add more fun while riding. It can make Mofit more plausible and fun for children who prefer to not wear a helmet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are exposed to many dangers as we ride a bike, a kickboard, and others. When the children ride together and try to make manual hand signals, accidents may occur and the children will not be able to react instantly and make the correct actions. To prevent these situations and provide safety for children when riding, Mofit was created. Children who are not familiar with riding a bike or riding together with friends or family, and parents who worry for their children can all enjoy safer riding with Mofit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMofit can be easily attached to all kinds of helmets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnecting Mofit to the phone is easy. Simply open the app and turn the Mofit device on and it will connect automatically through Bluetooth.\n\nDEMO VIDEO\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTPL Technology has been constantly developing sports mobility related products. The development began in effort to prevent the children from getting hurt through an accident while playing. \u00a0There are various products being sold in sports mobility market. Many unique and creative ideas and products are there, but TPL Technology aims to complete the development of the product focused more on safety.\nTPL Technology, with the heart of a loving family, has completed the development and created today's Mofit. Our goal is to help everyone enjoy sports mobility safely. We are confident that we will be able to accomplish our goal for sure."

It would make things better for the user to create a safe environment for our future generation. Pico Sense HAT comprises of sensors\n\nSHT31(Data Sheet) - The SHT31-DIS-B is a Humidity and Temperature Sensor builds on a new CMOSens\u00ae sensor chip that has increased intelligence, reliability and improved accuracy specifications compared to its predecessor.\nSGP40(Data Sheet) - The SGP40 is a new digital VOC (volatile organic compounds) sensor designed for easy integration into air purifiers or demand-controlled ventilation.\u00a0\nBME280(Data Sheet) - The BME280 is a humidity sensor especially developed for mobile applications and wearables where size and low power consumption are key design parameters. The unit combines high linearity and high accuracy sensors and is perfectly feasible for low current consumption, long-term stability and high EMC robustness. The humidity sensor offers an extremely fast response time and therefore supports performance requirements for emerging applications such as context awareness, and high accuracy over a wide temperature range.\nTCS34725(Data Sheet) - This device provides a digital return of red, green, blue (RGB), and clear light sensing values. An IR blocking filter, integrated on-chip and localized to the color sensing photodiodes, minimizes the IR spectral component of the incoming light and allows color measurements to be made accurately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many people that might ask that why should I care about the environment monitoring?\u201d which is a valid question. With the changing environment global warming, air pollution, water pollution etc. becoming the most dangerous problems for us. With the constant monitoring of the environment, we would get the data of the air pollution that would help us to take proper measures.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you are a Tech-enthusiast, a student, or a Tech-Hobbyist, this is the place for you.\"\nWe provide custom Raspberry Pi devices as well as controller-based application design and development. We are a UK-based company with a terrific and dedicated team who employ cutting-edge tools and machines to finish the procedure with precision. We've established ourselves as one of the top DIY inventors thanks to our innovative products and creative efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are proud to tell you that our only aim is to enhance the curiosity of people towards electronics products to make a great future for our world.

        "Text": "It's time to stop letting your phone control your life\nNever get enough done?\nAlways distracted?\nLike picking up your phone 150 times per day?\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial medias are designed to extract as much of our attention as possible. Our brains are up against teams of engineers who design products that use your psychology against you... Without even ever triggering your awareness.\nWe have no natural cognitive defence against this.\n\nWhy we can\u2019t afford to do nothing\nWe are already distracted, unproductive and stressed. Big Tech is pouring billions into making their products more addictive and manipulative. This world is our reality now - there is no escaping the attention economy. Each and every day it becomes easier to fall into a life of distraction.\u00a0\nDo you want to find out how your life will look when you're picking up your phone 300 times per day?\n\nIntroducing Rocket, the new social media that helps you focus\u00a0\nSocial media is the most powerful psychological tool out there. We have carefully designed Rocket to help you harness this powerful tool to unlock your full productive potential - getting you off your phone and helping you focus on whatever you need to do.\n\n\n\n\n\nRocket is built specifically for young, high-output individuals who want to control and protect their attention - people who can\u2019t afford to lose any time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow it works (the short version)\u00a0\nBefore you can see the posts on Rocket, first you have to get off your phone and focus for around 25 mins \u23f3. We call these Rocket timers, and they subtly nudge you to be more accountable with yourself and to avoid distractions.\nIt seems so simple, but this is what Rocket can do for you...\n\n#1 Turn some of the times you pick up your phone into 'Time Well Spent' \ud83d\udca1\u00a0\nRocket is great at capturing your attention with posts and notifications, just like any other social media. What it does from there is obviously very different though.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#2 Boost your productivity \u26a1\nGet more focus out of your day and get work done faster, as you\u2019re always only one notification or tap away from Rocket's effective focus timers. Rocket makes it such a mentally easy decision to get started on some work (and actually do it).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#3 Turn work into flow \ud83c\udf0a\u00a0\nRocket helps you rethink your work as a challenge rather than a chore. This makes you much more likely get you into what psychologists call \u2018flow\u2019 (it happens when the challenge of a task and your abilities are perfectly matched).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#4 Grow more aware and in control of your tech usage \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\nDisrupt existing bad tech habits. Over time Rocket helps you become more conscious of how much you use your phone and more aware of the effect of behavioural design on your actions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#5 Improve your ability to focus \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f\u00a0\nJust like with any other skill, you can train your focus. At the end of each timer you're prompted to ask yourself if you were focused or distracted. This forms an instant feedback loop that trains your mind to avoid the things that cause you to become distracted. We also give you tips to help you build better habits around your tech use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#6 Exchange ideas with and learn from other super smart and focused people \ud83e\udde0\u00a0\nBeing the place of focus, Rocket is naturally a hub of thoughtful people, great ideas and insightful reflections. See beyond what you usually see on the surface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#7 Be good to the environment and your mind \ud83c\udf31\u00a0\nWe donate to offset 1.2kg of CO2 for every hour of focus on Rocket. So far we have contributed towards projects that provide clean drinking water to Rwandan communities & help bring new innovative waste management practices to Vietnam. See more here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#8 Feel more fulfilled \ud83e\uddd8\nCompleting a timer of focus feels SO satisfying. Rocket also helps you celebrate the small wins by rewarding you after every timer and every task you complete :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat using Rocket looks like\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use Rocket for anything from 30 mins of focus per day to a full day of focus. Since it fits right in with your existing productivity tools, it's not a hassle to set up and you don't have to rely on using it all the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRewards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: We will never sell ads, and never sell your data. So Rocket will cost $10/month to keep us running.\nAvailable on iOS and Android. Should run smoothly on any smartphone less than 3 years old.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuccess so far\nOur early testers have collectively focused for more than 70000 minutes so far out of just ~75000 minutes of Rocket timers (yep, people are very rarely distracted when using Rocket).\n\nWe have also been actively involved in the local startup community here in Sydney, Australia. We've been learning heaps, participating in a bunch of courses, programs and pitch nights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur story\nHey I'm Cameron, the young solo creator of Rocket. It's been an amazing yet incredibly challenging journey so far. I've been playing the 3 startup roles all at once. This is possible as I am lucky enough to be alive at time where building a business can be done solo (albeit not easily) and in a part of the world with an abundance of resources and opportunity.\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you to my incredible support network of mentors, advisors and everyone else who has helped along the way!\n\nWhat got me started?\nI never imagined that one day I would build a social media. Truth be told I've never liked social media that much. This all began as I was simply interested in improving my productivity. I was never good at being able to focus on my work unless I had a tight deadline breathing down my neck. This was always stressful and I lost a lot of time to procrastination.\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough around 2 years of research and experimentation with multiple ideas it became clear to me that the biggest problem most of us face is distractions. Our 200 000 year old brains have not evolved to handle the vast amounts of information and context switching that we experience 24/7 in the Information Age. We pick up our phones 150 times per day on average (once every 6.5 minutes). Our \u2018attention residue\u2019, a term psychologists use, is spread everywhere, drastically reducing our cognitive performance. One study even found that it takes us on average 23 minutes to get focused on a task after a distraction. But that\u2019s just the start of the rabbit hole...\n\nWhy make Rocket?\nWe happen to live in an attention economy, where there is a strong economic incentive for pretty much all products \u2013 apps, websites, social medias, media, etc \u2013 to battle for your attention through whatever means possible. Our phones are a gateway to our attention.\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology is improving at an amazing rate, and every year our phones become a larger part of our lives. It follows that technology is manipulating away more and more of our attention.\n\nAt what point do we lose control of our attention completely? What will that mean for humanity?\n\nWe\u2019re simply not doing enough to avoid this catastrophe waiting to happen. We can\u2019t wait for regulators to step in or wait for Big Tech to grow a conscience. I believe it is a necessity to do something about this before it\u2019s too late. With Rocket I think I can play a part in helping drive some consumer awareness and build more demand for better technology that respects our attention.\n\n\nWhy we need your support!\nVenture Capital is great for some startups, however it necessitates aiming for crazy never-ending growth / profit above all else (and yes, sometimes profit above customers' wellbeing).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe believe we have to do things very differently, and that includes not taking the conventional Venture Capital path. We are really relying on your support to get off the ground. Not going to lie - we currently have a shoestring marketing budget, so we are relying on the proceeds from this campaign to kickstart our marketing and launch.\n\n\nIf you believe your attention should be yours, don't wait until it is too late.\nTo take a step to stand up for our attention, please support our Kickstart campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFast as a Rocket's Terms of Service can be found here."

        "Text": "INTRODUCING\nThe Elasto Mouse\nOur patented elastic click design removes the bottom of the mouse and frees your hands from the very uncomfortable experience of batting your finger against a hard surface hundreds of thousands of times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are not renderings, but real photos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n01. You click too much.\n\n\n\nThis is your hand, enduring tens of millions of clicks over a lifetime.\n\n\n\n\n02. You go \"ouch this sucks, this is very uncomfortable\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n03. Actually, you haven\u2019t been clicking but crashing against a hard surface thousands of times a day.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThis is your hand, clicking a brick-hard mouse button.\n\n\n\n\n\nSee? Your finger and wrist joints are in a 'mouse crash accident' every second.\n\n\n\n04. A little googling will confirm you that yes, repeated crashing onto the hand causes stress.\u00a0\n\n\n\nStructure of a traditional mouse\n\n\nThe above shows the skeleton of a typical mouse. The kind of mouse you have been using from your first encounter with a PC until now. Microswitches are located at the front of the mouse. They are the components that make the crisp click sound when you press down the mouse button.\n\nTHE PROBLEM IS that the switches lie below your fingertip. So when you click the button, your fingertip collides with the switch. Subsequently your finger, hand, and arm are injured.\n\nIn jargon, actuation distance and travel distance (there is a Glossary down this page!) are almost the same. This structure makes bottoming out so easy. In other words, it makes you slam your finger on the button. This is what we call an incident of a 'mouse-crash'.\n\n\n05. So we took the tension away by removing the hard stop.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAnd herein lies our great discovery and genesis for the bottomless mouse.\n\n\n\n06. Now you can click lightly.\nElasto's bottomless structure involves the Principle of the Lever.\n\n\n\n\nLever of a typical mouse (left) and Elasto (right)\n\n\nSo you need to apply only half of the actuation force to click the Elasto.\n\nWell, what about when you double-click?\n\n\n\nHigh impact forces with a typical mouse (left) and low smooth forces with Elasto (right) when double clicking\n\n\nAs the above graphic shows, double-clicking the typical mouse produces high and somewhat impact forces. In comparison, double-clicking the Elasto mouse produces low and smooth forces. This is because Elasto has a longer overtravel distance and uses the principle of the lever.\u00a0\n\nYou can click lightly with Elasto. More lightly than you can ever imagine.\n\n\n07. Back our Kickstarter to get an elastic, light clicking mouse.\u00a0\nWe promise ELASTO will save your hands.\n\n\n\nWoo!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong ergonomic mice, the most widespread type is the vertical mouse. The vertical mouse has an interesting concept of rotating the orientation of the hand to 45\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 compared to the typical mouse. Manufacturers claim that a typical mouse places your wrist in unnatural angles while the handshake position of the vertical mouse is natural.\n\nSome people love the vertical mouse. Since their arm and hand positions have changed, previously overused muscles come to a pause. So their wrist pain is somewhat relieved.\n\n\nDid vertical mouse really solve your issue? I mean, really?\n\nCan you click a vertical mouse without using your thumb?\nNo.\nThe vertical mouse will not stay steady unless your thumb supports it while the buttons are being clicked. In other words, your thumb and index finger must be involved in a 'pinching grip' to click. No wonder why my thumb was sore using the vertical mouse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScientific findings support this.\u00a0\n\nDr. David Rempel\u00b9 and his colleagues conducted a series of research to examine factors affecting carpal tunnel pressure. They found in 1997 that carpal tunnel pressure increases when the wrist position is in unneutral angles and when the fingertip is carrying out a pressing task\u00b2. A year later, they found that carpal tunnel pressure was even higher when pinching than simply pressing\u00b3. This means that clicking-and-dragging is worse than just clicking because a pinching grip is sustained.\n\nThis leads us to conclude that vertical mice can actually increase wrist tension. This could answer why wrist pain did not go away even when you changed to a vertical mouse.\n\n\u00b9 Dr. David Rempel is a Professor Emeritus in the Department of Medicine at UC San Francisco and Faculty in the Ergonomics Laboratory at UC Berkeley.\n\u00b2 Rempel, D.M., Keir, P.J., Smutz, W.P., and Hargens, A., 1997.

Elasto\u2019s buttons are awesome. Not only do they provide amazing comfort, but they feel satisfying. Bouncy, chewy, resilient, elastic - you define it when you get it. You\u2019ve got to feel it to judge it. You will be amazed at how light Elasto\u2019s buttons are!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPOWER MODE at your convenience\nYour Elasto will arrive with an AA battery installed for you. However, if you would like to enjoy the benefit of a rechargeable mouse, we devised the Elasto so you can easily switch mode to a rechargeable mouse. Insert a rechargeable lithium-ion battery and set to Li-ion mode on the Elasto. Charge with a USB-C cable to keep it going. (Note: Li-ion battery and USB-C cable are not included.)\n\nWIRELESS MODE of your selection\nElasto provides Bluetooth freedom. No Bluetooth? No problem. Plug in the provided 2.4G USB dongle and you\u2019re good to go.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na. Travel distance\nThe distance from the top of the button (unpressed) to the bottom of the button (when pressed all the way down to fully bottom out). Travel distance is the sum of pretravel and overtravel distance.\n\nb. Actuation (actuation point, actuation distance, actuation force)\nWhen you push downward the mouse button, in most cases with a tactile bump, the switch is actuated. Actuation point refers to the point when electrical contact is made (i.e., the switch turns \u201con\u201d). Actuation distance is the distance from the top of the button (unpressed) to actuation point. Actuation force is the force needed to reach the actuation point. You must press the key to this amount in order for the switch to be recognized. Mouse switches with high actuation force require stronger force, while switches with low actuation force are light to press. This value depends on the switch manufacturer such as Omron, Kailh, etc.\n\nc. Applied force\nApplied force is the amount of force used to press a button. When applied force exceeds actuation force, this suggests excessive strain or bottoming out the button. Minimizing applied force by all means is strongly recommended for sound hands. This can be achieved by clicking gently (your job) or devising a mouse with a low actuation force (click switch or mouse manufacturer\u2019s job).\n\nd. Pretravel\nBefore reaching the point of actuation, the button descends some distance. This is \u2018pretravel\u2019. This prevents erratic switch actuation.\n\ne. Overtravel\nAfter the point of actuation, the button may be able to move further downwards. In this case, electrical contact is made (i.e., the switch turns \u201con\u201d) before the button is fully depressed. The additional distance that the button can continue to be pressed after actuation is \u2018overtravel\u2019. Overtravel means that buttons do not have to be struck hard or pressed all the way down. When overtravel is provided, chances of finger fatigue are low particularly when using the mouse at a high rate of speed. Elasto\u2019s bottomless structure using the lever allows the longest overtravel among any button-clicking mouse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe birth of Elasto dates back to 2018. Elasto\u2019s founder Unice was troubled with her puffy sore index finger joint, numb forearm, and tension in the hand after working on the computer mouse 16 hours a day. She tried alternative mice \u2013 including ergonomically vertical mice \u2013 but after a few days of seeming relief, she felt pain again in different parts this time.\nHer loving father Sang heard Unice complaining about her discomfort. As an engineer who devoted his life to the study of mechatronics, he immediately figured out what the problem was in a typical mouse.\nCollision = Shock = Harm to hand. (Newton\u2019s third law)\nHe found an aged-to-yellow mouse from the storage. He adjusted it so that the mouse button had a longer travel distance than what the default Omron microswitch provided \u2014 longer overtravel distance, to be precise.\n\n\n\nThis crude prototype supported Sang\u2019s idea: short overtravel harms the finger while long overtravel saves finger.\n\n\nUnice began using the reformed mouse. Some weeks later, she surprisingly found that she had completely forgotten about finger pain. Her arm was also improving. At last Unice\u2019s hand was safe. However, as time passed, there were some issues regarding durability. So the prototype was modified multiple times before Unice and Sang decided to make mice as a business.\n\nUnice and Sang are specialists in observing and releasing bodily tension. They both are certified Alexander Technique (AT) teachers. For a total of 13 years, they have been helping numerous students refrain from engaging in harmful habits of posture and tension and guiding healthier ones. According to AT, you are eligible to consciously inhibit yourself from pounding on the computer mouse. If you are careful, you would click gently with little tension. No doubt that this is true in all circumstances. However, not all of you are trained to consciously control how you live your body. For instance, it is close to impossible to consciously control your clicking habit when you are in a state of mind completely immersed in what you are doing on a computer.\u00a0\nAs \u2018tension releasing specialists\u2019, team Elasto designed the invention so that your hands don\u2019t get tense without having you even know it.

I'm Vanessa, a 39 year old single mother of two beautiful children; 14 year old girl and 11 year old boy. For all of my adult life I have been the planner/organizer of events in the family. I am the last of 10 children so...very big and lively family! I've planned, coordinated and executed events big and small from birthday parties, to most recently, weddings. I thoroughly enjoy doing this kind of work so I thought to create an events management business that would allow me to put my talents to good use and also create a legacy for my children. Just as I was gearing up to get things going (began my Master's certificate in Event Management program), the COVID-19 Pandemic hit the nation.\u00a0\nWith COVID came the state and country-wide mandated \"stay-at-home orders.\" I realized that this climate may not be the best time to start my business as envisioned, for the very simple fact that its success relies heavily on people gathering together for these different occasions. I was able to complete my Event Management Master's Certificate program this past July (2021) and I felt reinvigorated to get my first endeavor started. I set out to see how I could do something else (in the meantime) that would satisfy a need that has gone unmet for a number of years. With the help of my two little ones, and after a lot of hours brainstorming and consulting with the people I trust; I landed on the idea that I am bringing to you all now.\u00a0\nA mobile application. One that will provide a means for Event Professionals (Event Managers, Planners, Caterers, Decorators, Photographers, etc.) to network, collaborate, and better meet the needs of their clients. I landed on this idea for a few reasons: 1) because after years of planning various events, my experience (which was in line with the market research) was that there was no seamless way to acquire event professionals or vendors outside of google searches and/or utilizing existing relationships; 2) There were various apps out there that aid in the event planning process, but nothing that directly focuses on connecting event professionals and their clients ; and 3) Even with COVID, I saw a steady uptick of in-person events around the country; toward the last quarter of the year folks began having their events. The events were looking a little different due to the observance of the COVID-19 safety guidelines, but they were still being held.\u00a0\nI saw the need for my App grow as it would assist in filling the gap and helping those in the industry like myself, and their clients get connected more efficiently. To that end, I wrote out the details of what I'd like the features of the App to be and I began scouting for App Developers.\u00a0\nApp Features and Functionality\n- Users will be required to sign-up/register on the app, they will create a profile either as a client or an event professional. Event professionals will pay a subscription fee to join, Clients will be able to sign up for free.\u00a0\n-Clients will be able to create a post detailing the services they require for their event\u00a0\n- Event Professionals (service providers) will be required create a profile for their business/service that provides clients with the business name, a description of services, ratings and reviews from past customers, a portfolio, and any packages if available.\u00a0\n-Event Professionals will review clients' job posts and submit a proposal for service.\n-Clients will review and compare all proposals directly inside the app. They will be able to contact the service provider via the application and select the package and scope of services in the application.\u00a0\n- All services acquired for a specific event will be housed in the app under that event posting. Clients will be able to connect and communicate with all their service providers in one place via app chat for each of their events.\u00a0\n- Clients will be able to submit ratings for each vendor at the conclusion of their contract. Ratings will be added to the service providers profile.\u00a0\n- Service providers will be ranked on the app according to these ratings. Highly rated service providers will get more exposure on the app and therefore more job offers.\nI connected with four companies for development. After reviewing proposals from each, I decided to go with the company offering the best quality and most comprehensive service. I am currently in phase 3 out of 4 of development and I am requesting your support to push through to completion and marketing. I believe that this app will have a significant impact on this industry and I'd like you to be a part of it. Thanks in advance for your generosity!"

Post treatments can be multiple (from simple devices like a water pitcher to reverse osmosis)\nWhether you are in scenario i) and ii), we have two questions for you:\n1) Do you really know what is in your tap water?\n2) Are you using the right water post-treatment?\nDifficult questions, right? Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t need to answer. We will give you the answer to these questions.\nThe quality of your tap water at home can vary and depends on many factors such as the region where you live, your municipal water supply, etc.\u2026Think about the distance traveled by water from the outlet of your municipal water treatment plant to your kitchen\u2019s faucet. You have probably already heard about water lead contamination due to old pipelines, or plastic microfibers pollution due to legal or illegal discharge of containers in water sources, or even organic pesticides. Pollutants can leak out of wastewater treatment and industrial plants and enter the water supply.\nTherefore, tap water can contain pollutants as microplastics, pesticides, heavy metals, chlorine, fluoride, lead and even radioactive compounds. These pollutants can be harmful for your health if not maintained at low concentrations or traces. Even when kept at the level of traces, pollutants can lead to long-term health issues.\nDo you really know what's in your tap water?\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0The problem with Water pitchers\u00a0\nMany people across the globe use a water pitcher to filter and store tap water before drinking it.\nDid you know that most of the water pitchers available in the market (including most famous brands) are not capable to filter most of the pollutants that might be in your tap water? Some pollutants are partially removed, most not at all.\nOk you maybe knew that\u2026but did you know about the breeding ground problem in water pitchers? Did you hear about secondary water pollution?\nLet us explain\u2026city water contains bacteria coming from biofilm (bacteria that grow in the surface) in the pipes. Water pitcher cartridges are playgrounds for bacteria and microorganisms to grow and develop. This increased concentration of bacteria can threaten the safety of your water. While your pitcher cartridge is filtering some pollutants from your tap water, it is adding and increasing bacteria and microorganisms in your tap water.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are probably asking yourself\u2026what\u2019s now? How can I drink my tap water being sure that all the harmful pollutants and bacteria are filtered out?\nThe solution \u2013 The BluAct \u201cAll-in-one\u201d for ultimate water filtration\nBluAct Technologies has the solution for you. BluAct All-in-one is a water filtration system capable to filter all the pollutants you might find in your tap water and to protect your water from secondary pollution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0The technology behind The BluAct \u201cAll-in-one\u201d solution\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe BluAct All-in-one solution instantly filter out all the contaminants you could find in your tap water, from pesticides, passing through heavy metals to bacteria\u2026 everything is removed. How? With a four stages filtration cartridge: 1) a plant-based washable fabric take care of macroparticles and dust, 2) a coconut carbon block take care of your water taste, smell and microfiltration, 3) the BluAct patented granulated media with milk proteins remove the heavy metals and organic pollutants, and 4) a last stage hollow fibers take care of the microbiology of water.\nThis is called the ultimate purification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust filter what you need, when you need it. With the diverter valve attached to the faucet, you can choose when to filter water. Use clean filtered water to prepare your favorite drinks, from your coffee/tea in the morning to your detox waters to stay hydrate all day long. Don\u2019t\u2019 forget to use safe filtered water to rinse your veggies and fruits. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWherever you live around the globe, connect BluAct countertop to your faucet and drink tap water safely.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Product is certified by the world health organization (WHO) under the household water treatment system (HWTS) scheme, at the NSF international laboratories in Michigan, USA, Swiss government and it is in compliance with food contact regulations.\u00a0\nSingle-use plastic water bottles are polluting our oceans, rivers, streets, landfills and poisoning our air when they're burned in incinerators. One million plastic bottles are bought around the world every minute. Experts predict that there will be one pound of plastic in the ocean for every three pounds of fish by 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe product is available in chrome and white color.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It\u2019s about connecting people so they are never alone if they have a phone, or not able to share what they feel with loved ones or friends as we don\u2019t sometimes need their judgement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is how the idea for emood was born;\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02020 January - Beaumont hospital (emergency surgery - very bad infection)\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the evening meal, Nurse ( I do not even remember her name ) came to me ( she usually works in different ward but that day she was at St. Mary's ward - night shift) we talked for a while ( she was doing exams and bloods in the meantime)and she asked me \"do you have Netflix? - watch secrets.

        "Text": "Turn a walk into a Full Body Workout\nMY WALK, is an electronic portable handheld device designed to encourage a walking style that achieves more benefits in less time than normal walking and engages more muscles, 90% as opposed to only 40% standard walk.\nMY WALK works in harmony with your body and smartly prompts you to excel intuitively.\nThink Nordic Walk, without the cumbersome poles.\n\n\n\nMY WALK device\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Action\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Body Workout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does MY WALK work\n\u2022 The key MY WALK's effectiveness is it helps you to execute proper form more often than not, a full rep.\n\u2022 A walk is vastly improved to burn more calories and engage more muscles by encouraging the user to properly and fully elevate the forward swinging arm to a pre-determined level. Thus working not only the lower body but engaging the upper body torso, arms, back, neck, shoulders and hands.\n\u2022 When the forward arm reaches the pre-determined level an alert is emitted from the device, either flashing light, sound, vibration or a combination of these. Also the full rep is added to the counter so at the end of your walk workout you can see how many full reps for each arm.\n\u2022 The higher the elevation the faster a person will intuitively walk, propelling the user forward naturally and subconsciously. Pace and stride length instinctively increases also triggering proper/better posture, straight back, raised head. MY WALK works in harmony with the body and in sync with the user's ability.\n\u2022 MY WALK somewhat mimics Nordic Walking but surpasses it by having a greater range of elevation and ensuring the user is performing the forward arm swing to proper form and full rep.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenefits both Mind and Body\nThe benefits of walking are well proven, documented and accepted globally.\nSuperboost your walk with MY WALK and gain more benefits, swiftly and easily.\nLow impact, easy to do, fun, suitable for everyone, only 10 \u2013 30 minutes a day.\nYou decide pace and place.\nFeel good, fit, trim, tone and healthier faster.\n\n20 benefits, 30 minutes daily walk\n\n\n\n20 Benefits of a 30 minute daily walk\n\n\nHow it all started\nAfter years of immense stress at work, an endless travel schedule to clients, meetings and trade-shows, and ignoring all the warning signs, my mind and body finally and severally showdown. My acute burnout happened in Australia, as far away from family and home as I could be. When I was finally discharged from hospital I made my way back home on mentally torturous long flights back to Sweden. Once home my doctor strongly recommended that I take up some form of regular exercise to aid my long road to recovery. In 2015 I took up walking after years of a sedentary lifestyle. \u00a0I am now 61 years old and have never been fitter in both mind and body, nor more toned, this I greatly attribute to the MY WALK device. The inspiration came to me on a regular walk around our local lake. After much R&D, prototype testing, first mould batch testing we now have 2000 pairs of MY WALK ready to full test the market. MY WALK was a major factor in my recovery and I hope that it will help others no matter what their motivation or goal is.\n\n\n\nMY WALK\n\n\n\n\n\nLow impact exercise\n\n\nMY WALK Timeline\n\n\n\nMY WALK Timeline\n\n\nSuper-boost other exercises too\n\n\n\nStep Ups\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnboxing MY WALK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove clear plastic strip from between contacts to power-up MY WALK\n\n\nUser's Manual\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMY WALK the Multi Award Winning Product\nMY WALK won two prestigious awards, one from ALMI and the other from Landstinget.\n1/ ALMI is a government organisation that assists entrepreneurs and local businesses through both financial and advisory support.

Its not the 9 Volts I wanted but it works perfectly.\nI honestly said this will take me 4-8 weeks at first it took almost 4 years of hell to create it so I am proud all that hard work paid off now I have the prototype hopefully it can be mass produced sold and help people all over the world have a hot meal with no kitchen needed.\nI was the designer engineer and the whole team only Llewyn from PRINT-3D.COM.AU Sydney he was amazing supportive and the only 3D designer that cared and put hard work in without breaking the bank as other 3D designers wanted an arm and leg I\u2019m still in contact with him to this day.\nThis all exhausted me and sent me broke and I used up all my money on parts batteries tools it was all made by me except the 3D plastic casing I designed it and had it built for the final prototype, I have a second earlier prototype it\u2019s pretty ugly and crude but it works.\nI am currently broke and scraping through week to week to acheive my dream.\n\nThe InstaCook business plans starts off with a great one-of-a-kind portable 5 side heating cook pot the base and 4 sides heat and cook evenly making a faster and better meal with the lid on it is a 6 sides spere heated capsule, patented portable battery powered cooker the battery can run from 10 min to 1 hour (standard battery runs 26 min) of cook time that can be taken everywhere like work, parks home, mobile homes, cars, camping, schools and for military use by soldiers, it is great for student or any anyone in a small living place or at work It does not just heat like a microwave it can heat or cook from scratch fast anywhere anytime, with no radiation.\n\nI am my own management, I have worked in many companies finance telecommunications, Beverage, technology and plenty more over the last 20 years, I have been inventions since I was 7 years old, My parents abused and tortured me for over 20 years they destroyed all my inventions and designed and did horrible things to me it took me a long time to get over the trauma and get back into my inventions, I want to build TAK innovations into a empire and I want to help all the people that need help and get them away from domestic violence and all forms of abuse so people can be the best people they can be without having to live in a hell or fear that they don\u2019t know they can get away from, I don\u2019t want to be rich and famous for the glory but I want to invent create and make this world a better place so people don\u2019t have to live in fear and pain, inventing creating building and helping it is my love and passion and I now want to dedicate the rest of my life to, I have had a lot of business experience, my loves and engineering all science it is what I was born to do, I am my manager, inventor, designer builder, accountant and tech R&D.\nInstaCook solves the problem of trying to get through there busy days with having something as important as a hot meal without a kitchen, where they can take it and re heat or cook at their desk at work while working while others 20 people using the microwave, It will solve the problem of Uni student living in their small shared boarding house and being able to cook or heat in there room, it\u2019s also great for people camping, picknick or military\nPeople who want to cook but don\u2019t have a kitchen in there small living space. Uni Students can take last nights dinner to class. City living office workers who only have 1 microwave & 20 people. The military soldiers who want a hot cooked meal. Young to middle-aged people who have busy lives. Campers who want a cooked or heated up meal. Picknicks, the elderly that are forced to like in small shoe box city unit with no kitchen in a boarding house.\nI want this product for everyone\u2019s use that may not be possible as most people suggest camping, There are so many other uses I have used it my self-living in a boarding house where the kitchen was filthy and they would was there cloths in the sink, I would like to aim this at office workers, students, camping picnic and construction workers basically anyone who does not have a lot of time space, & wants to save money by putting last nights or pre made meals\nI will advertise this product for all use that may not be possible as most people suggest camping, There are so many other uses I have used it my self-living in a boarding house where the kitchen was filthy & they would was there cloths in the sink, I would like to aim this at office workers, students, camping a picnic & construction workers basically anyone who does not have a lot of time space, & wants to save money by putting last nights or pre made meals.\nI have calculated a minimum amount of $110000 to cover the project and get it in production in a couple of months and the full manufacture over 24 months for this version, The $110000 investment will be for 11% of the business and raw profit turning it into a raw $1017663 within 24 months.\nThe estimated cost of the high-quality unit will be $50 per unit sell wholesale $129 and the marketable RRP of $179 giving us with a raw profit of $79 per unit\nCompletely battery powered\nSeparate power supply from the unit\nAll sides and base are all heated with the lid on it\u2019s a 6-sided super heating capsule.\nHand heled\nCan warm and cook\nFood can be kept locked in the container for heating later on\nSteaming option\nCompletely sealed\nUnit can be placed in a dish washer for cleaning\nDifferent size and duration battery packs 10 minutes to 1 hour.\nHeating between 200 \u2013 300 degrees Celsius\nClear visual lid\nPower supply or USB port.\nBatteries can be recharged by power point the car 12v port or any USB recharger or even off your PC.\nCompletely portable.\nWaterproof cooking unit splash proof battery put the unit in the dishwasher sick or wipe down the non-stick cook wear\nBatteries are interchangeable small to large 10 min to 60 min.\nTake it to work, heat up lunch on your desk take it camping, picnics\nBoil water.\nCooks or heats depending on what you want.\nCooks rice steams rice and vegetables.\nCook eggs pre maid meals, last night\u2019s diner.\nHeats all 5 sides not just the base, it heats the base and all 4 walls.\nFits in backpack cars even handbags.\nWhen you want to clean it throw it in the dish washer.\nI plan on advertising radio TV online, I honestly don\u2019t use social media yet as I have a very busy work life between work and working on this and some responsibilities, I have not used media even though I know its very effective and important.\nI want to start selling it online on my website, eBay Amazon I also will like to get it into stores like Jaycar and Kmart and possibly infomercials I believe this will work and word of mouth will also spread.\n\nI honestly want to make the world a better place for people and animals with the money I make from this project and future company I dont need much money to live I really want to use the money to help others and animals as I have a passion for helping animals and people as I take in abandon animals and re habilitate them and return them to nature but if they cant I keep them, I volonter on my days off rehabilitating abused dog that people are scared to help I have been bitten over 500 time but its worth it once you see the dog finaly realised he is safe loved and can now he held patted and re homed or continue the rehabilitation.\n\nEVERYTHING TAST BETTER COOKED NOT MICROWAVED EVERYONE KNOWS THIS & IT COOKS FAST.\nWHO EVERFINDS ME A BACKS ME WILL BE GREATLEY REWARDED AS THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING!"

Use your free time, you can generate an extra income, identify a necessity develop something for that necessity, use our machine to manufacture it, and build a very lucrative business around plastic.\nHow does it work?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtended version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain advantages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Our injection machines vs 3D Printers.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA 3D printer is mostly used to make prototypes. A manual plastic injection machine is made to make the parts in series. Don\u2019t waste your money with failed 3D prints, expensive and delicate materials.\nA lot of people have the idea that a 3D printer is autonomous, but it is not, you have to make the file and send it to the printer (for each piece or set), you have to take off the pieces once they are ready if they have supports you have to trim them, you have to change the filament, and there are some common issues, jams, gaps, everything is delicate. If nothing goes wrong for example at the end of the day, you will have 10 pieces\u2026 with our machines 10 pieces is a matter of minutes, the same time you spend on the setup. Don\u2019t use your 3D printer to do parts in series there is a better solution for that (our machines).\nOur machines are more than 40 times faster on average than a traditional 3D printer. The materials on average for our machines are 25 times cheaper. With a bigger variety. Lower power consumption. Power consumption is almost the same, but with our injection machines at the same time, you can make a lot more pieces, so the power consumption per piece is less with our machines.\nBetter quality and presentation, less extra prosses. If for some reason one piece is damaged or without the quality or any error, you can easily recycle it, with our machines there is no waste.\nA 3D printer is by far noisier than our machines.\nCommon questions\nWhat can I inject with these machines?\nOur injection machines are ideal to inject small plastic parts for many industries. Some products that you can inject are toys, kitchen accessories, pet toys, bathroom accessories, gears and mechanisms, accessories for phones, ornaments, make prototypes, mixing colors, and do plastic-color tests, self-defense products, sex toys, dental prosthesis, spare parts, automotive spares, complements for furniture, bicycle spares \u2013 parts, motorcycle spare \u2013 parts, fantasy jewelry, construction complements and more.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat kinds of plastic can I use?\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use any plastic with a melting index above 12. You can find that index, in the datasheet of the plastic. You can use mainly: Polyethylene (LD - HD), Polypropylene, TPU, SBS, ABS, TR, Impact PS, crystal PS, PVC flexible, nylon, polyamides, compounds with fiberglass, and more. You can use almost every recycled plastic from injection parts, always do your tests first.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat colors can I use?\nYou can make any color you want. You can use masterbatch or dust pigment, each has advantages and disadvantages, masterbatch is slower but cleaner, dust pigments are faster to use but they are dirtier. when you change the color, the plastic will be mixed, so you have to waste some plastic, inject parts until the color is uniform. There are specialized purges to help to clean the machine, purges are useful to change color or the type of plastic.\nMolds\n\n\n\n\n\nMolds are not included with any perk.\nThe molds for a manual injection machine are by far cheaper than the molds for a hydraulic machine. Because the molds weigh less than a traditional mold, is easier to work with a small piece of metal. Molds can be easily done in a CNC machine, if you don\u2019t have access to a CNC machine, we will implement a service for you, where you can send the file and we make the mold for you, and if you have a CNC machine we will sell blanks, pieces of metal that you can mill, to make your mold.\n\u00a0How many pieces am I going to inject a day?\nWell first is a manual injection machine, it doesn\u2019t work by itself, you can work 1 hour or 10 for example. Also, depending on the practice you have and the kind of plastic that you use. But the thing that influences the most is the size of the plastic part that you are going to inject. You can make 30,000 a day or 300.\nFor example, in the video we inject 4 pieces every 3.5 minutes, more or less, without considering the first 15 minutes, to make it easier let\u2019s say 4 minutes. If you work 8 hours and maintain that rhythm of injections, you can make 480 pieces, with a 3d printer that work will take you 320 hours or 40 days considering 8 hours a day (making one by one, if you make the maximum of the size of the bed it will take more time because the nozzle has to travel more) imagine that in the bed of the 3D printer can fit 10 pieces like the one that we injected on the video. Imagine that you are at \u00be of the work and it fails\u2026you will lose a lot of time, and money. So, choose wisely, if you need to make plastic parts in series, with that number we can say that injecting a part is 40 times faster than 3d printing a part.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Mold blanks.\nIs a piece of metal, with one face milled, in the other face you can mill the cavity that you want to make a useful mold. Mold blanks are made of a special alloy, zinc-based. This alloy is very used in the mold industry because leaves a metal without pores, and allows milling the mold easily (metal chips won\u2019t stick to the endmill), with the necessary resistance, with a good cavity finish, and is easy to polish. we have many sizes available. With these blanks you forget the foundry process, you just place the blank in your CNC and mill the cavities of the mold.\n\n\n\n\n\nTest mold available as a complement\nIt\u2019s a mold with 4 cavities, with this mold you can test different kinds of plastic, different temperatures and learn how to use the machine. The piece is a \u201cpadlock\u201d for bags. You can add this complement to your existing pledge.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent models\n\n\n\n\n\nOne solution for your needs and budget. Our machines are ideal for: developers, engineers, Hobbyists, a plastic laboratory, small manufacturers, small workshops, entrepreneurs.\nBasic \u2013 Ideal for the ones how wants to have the first contact, with manual injection, great for small productions.\nProfessional \u2013 Ideal for the ones how need more production and faster, bigger screen.\nPremium \u2013 Ideal for the ones how need bigger productions. More capacity. Tactile screen with different setups.\nIndustrial - Ideal for the ones how wants to, the biggest capacity for an injection manual machine 180 cm3, reenforced materials, for harder work. Bigger mold holder. For bigger plastic parts that consume more plastic, with thicker walls more than 2.5mm.\nIndustrial images will be updated in a few days\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment and Tests\nFor years we have used the previous models of our machines, to make our products or more of our machines. With that base that we have from previous years\u2026 the mission was clear: better quality, make them more durable, improve the time that takes to inject a piece. It was a complicated mission but I guess it was accomplished. Everything was planned, tested, and modified until it works as planned. With time it may not look as new but it will still work fine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Message from the creator\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchedule\n\n\n\n\n\nPledges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShipping\nMachine Will be shipped disassembled, but you just have to plug the base and few screws...

As a person who spent a lot of time on social media (better to say, wasted time), it\u2019s about 4 hours a day, I noticed that I was not productive anymore. I spent money on stuff that I bought from Instagram, and I do not even need all of them, but marketing algorithms in social media works so well, so they can control our life and action.\n\u00a0To avoid this impact, I want to create a unique mobile application that helps us reduce the time we spend on social media.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe application will have the name The Free Mind. (The name came from a feeling I got after not using social media for a while). Also, The Free Mind will have a beneficial things such as bonuses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0How to use it:\u00a0\nOpen the app, enter your name and last name, and connect your existing social media to your The Free Mind account. Then choose from the left side which social media you would like to block. Once you have at least one account blocked, the time will be counted when you are offline but your cell phone is active.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Then it is easy to convert offline hours to credits(It is its currency in The Free Mind).\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0You can spend Credits as you want. You can take a coffee, book, dinner, etc., just using Credits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0This app will help people be less addicted to social media and get bonuses."

With our new, stylish grain flaker, the electrical YouFlaker.\n\nWolfgang Mock,\nthe ingenious grain mill builder with 40 years of experience has developed the YouFlaker for us, together with designers from the Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences and the team that, years ago, developed the legendary Hawo's mills and most recently the Mockmill grain mills.\n\nWe, David and Philipp from YouFlake in Berlin,\noffer various raw organic muesli base mixes and delicious toppings - and now finally a stylish flaker (grain flaker) for making a really healthy, fresh muesli breakfast yourself. It's quick and easy, at the push of a button!\n\n\n\nThe team: David Niermann | Wolfgang Mock | Philipp Roeser\n\n\nOur flaker already makes great flakes\nIn order to be able to go into series production with the YouFlaker, we need your support. So far, there has been a fully functional, tried-and-tested model with all technical components in a 3D-printed housing. The next step is the transfer to series production, which incurs costs for the creation of the casting tools (for casting the housing from renewable raw materials, see below) and for setting up and scaling series production. With your contribution you help us pre-finance these costs.\n\n\n\nThe 3D-printed YouFlaker prototype flaking our organic muesli\n\n\nVideo demo of the core functionality...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: The prototype is a bit top-heavy. This will be solved in the final version by adding two weights at the bottom.\n\nBut first: why flake-it-yourself at all?\nFirst, an analogy that most people will get immediately:\nAnyone who wants to drink good coffee rightly expects the coffee beans to be freshly ground, as the fresh processing simply makes the coffee taste better. The flavors come into their own. That is why coffee is freshly ground in every good caf\u00e9, and more and more people are grinding their own coffee at home as well.\n\nExactly the same applies to muesli and cereals that are processed into flakes. The fresh aromas of the grain are retained in the best quality when prepared right before consumption. The flakes are significantly more absorbent when fresh and soften more quickly in liquid. In addition to the aromas - and this is in what it differs from coffee - when fresh oat flakes are squeezed, important nutrients are retained in the best quality as well. More on that now...\n\nSo why squeeze oats into oatmeal yourself when you can buy oatmeal in any supermarket?! Hardly anyone knows: Industrially produced oat flakes are heated up to 100\u00b0C. First, the oats are treated with hot steam, then rolled and then dried again over high heat. This conserves the oat flakes for a very long time, but it also damages many nutrients, especially enzymes and B vitamins. We had this examined in the laboratory using the enzyme lipase. The lipase breaks down fats into their constituent parts. It is only thanks to this that the body can digest the fats contained in food and use its own fat reserves for energy production (source: NetDoktor.de). Enzymes are very sensitive to heat and are irreversibly destroyed at approx. 50\u00b0C. Fresh processing is therefore all the more important - without prior heating to preserve it. This is only possible with the YouFlaker!\n\nEnzyme activity of the enzyme lipase in nkat/g\n\n\n\nOrganic oat flakes [blue] vs freshly flaked organic naked oat flakes (YouFlake) [orange] | Source: Lab analysis report, bilacon GmbH, 2019/04/05\n\n\nSome of the B vitamins are similarly sensitive to heat. We looked at vitamins B3 (niacin) and B6 (pyridoxine). Vitamin B3 is an important component of the coenzymes NAD and NADH, which help the body generate energy for metabolism. It is found in all living cells in the human body, especially in central organs such as the liver and kidneys and in fatty tissue. Vitamin B6 also plays a central role in metabolism. It is required by the body to convert and incorporate proteins, it contributes to the formation of neurotransmitters (messenger substances in the nerve cells) and has an effect on the immune system.\n\nB vitamins B3 and B6 in \u00b5g\n\n\n\nOrganic oat flakes [blue] vs organic naked oats (YouFlake) [orange] | Source: MRI - German Federal Research Institute for Nutrition and Food at the German Federal Ministry for Nutrition and Agriculture\n\n\nThese are the differences in quality that have been investigated so far. There are probably more, because oats contain numerous other enzymes and essential nutrients in addition to lipase. The point is: the freshness simply pays off! You notice this in the nutrients and, above all, in the taste. Many of our customers tell us that after having made their own flakes for the first time, they no longer want to eat the pre-processed oat flakes from the supermarket!\n\nThis applies not only to oats, but of course to other types of grain such as spelt or rye, too. Fresh flakes simply taste better!\n\nYouFlaker: Housing made from 100% renewable resources\nThe innovative material Arboblend\u00ae created by the Swabian company Tecnaro is used for the housing. It is a sustainable material made from 100% renewable raw materials, but it can be cast into a mold just as easily as a plastic. This means that large quantities can be produced cheaply and sustainably at the same time. Arboblend\u00ae is not only particularly sustainable, but is also has a significantly better visual and haptic appearance compared to conventional plastic. Lignins made from vegetable fibers are used to manufacture Arboblend\u00ae. These cause the plant cells to harden and thus ensure the strength of wood. Lignin is a \"waste product\" in the paper industry. Therefore, it is widely available in large quantities at low cost. The housing is basically made of wood, just poured into shape and without using additional wood. Innovative and resource-saving!\n\nEasy to open and clean\nYou can easily remove the squeezing mechanism (with the two rollers) by removing the top cover and then pulling the squeezing mechanism out towards the front. Then you can dry clean it with either a paint brush or some other small brush (such as a toothbrush). The squeezing mechanism can also be cleaned under running water and with a drop of dishwashing detergent for thicker deposits.\n\n\n\nUnlocking the top cover using the black flap behind the spout\n\n\n\n\n\nLifting off the top cover\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoval of the squeezing mechanism\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoved squeezing mechanism with stainless steel rollers\n\n\n\n\n\nDry cleaning of the rollers with a bristle brush\n\n\n\n\n\nYouFlaker scope of delivery: Flocker with motor, squeezer, top cover, lid, IEC cable\n\n\nAnd as a video...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPowerful & efficient electric motor\nThe electric DC motor has more than sufficient power to easily squeeze all types of grain (except corn - too big and too hard) as well as oil seeds such as flaxseed, sunflower seeds, hemp seeds or sesame. In this way, all muesli ingredients are freshly squeezed in no time.\n\nQuiet\nThe squeezing process is relatively quiet. The two stainless steel rollers squeeze grain and seeds with playful ease. The engine hums quietly and pleasantly. Audible, but you can still chat comfortably next to it. For the techies among us: When squeezing, the volume is around 60 dB. That corresponds roughly to the volume when talking at low volume.\n\n100 grams of fresh flakes per minute\nWith the YouFlaker you can produce 100 grams of fresh flakes per minute at the push of a button. It only takes half a minute for a 50 gram serving to turn whole oats (as well as other grains and seeds) into fresh oat flakes. Next, add one of our toppings and, if you like, fresh fruits and berries as well as (plant) milk - and the incomparably fresh muesli is ready!\n\nFrom the design study...\nBefore the prototype from the 3D printer and the finished series product came the design drafts on paper and on the computer...\n\n\n\nFirst drafts\n\n\n\n\n\nEngineering drawing\n\n\n\n\n\nThe design draft for the stylish flaker\n\n\n\n\n\nView from above\n\n\n\n\n\nView from the side\n\n\n\n\n\nFilling raw organic muesli into the hopper\n\n\n\n\n\nColor games\n\n\n\n\n\nOne or two colors?\n\n\n\n\n\nColor games #2\n\n\n... via the prototype from the 3D printer...\nAll photos are taken from the 3D printed prototype. In this case, the housing is still made of \"normal\" plastic, as only certain plastics can be used in 3D printing. The visual and haptic impression of the device will therefore change slightly. Arboblend looks a little less smooth than most other plastics, makes a high-quality impression and is pleasant to the touch.\n\n\n\nYouFlaker prototype: Lifting off the top cover\n\n\n... to the series product\nWe will update you with photos of the finished series product once they are available...\n\nSpecs\n\nInput power: 130W\nInput voltage: 100-240V @ 50/60 Hz (runs on any mains voltage anywhere in the world)\nVolume: 60 dB\nFlake output: 100 g/min of fresh flakes\nRollers: Stainless steel (wear-free), 35 mm in diameter, 12 mm wide\n\n\nADD-ON: The organic muesli for YouFlaker...\n(only available for European customers due to import restrictions)\nWe have developed our muesli base with raw organic grain to match the fresh processing with the YouFlaker. You can also add these as a sample package (size M or size L). In combination with the YouFlaker, you can get our sample kit at a particularly affordable price - with a discount of around 10 euros. So you can start flaking right away! It's worth it!\n\nYouFlake organic muesli base\nFor our organic muesli base, we only use raw and organic cereals (naked oats, spelt, buckwheat) and seeds (linseed, sunflower seeds, sesame), which must be squeezed with a grain flaker before consumption in order to produce cereal flakes and to squeeze the seeds (particularly important with flaxseed!).\n\n\n\nMuesli base: Nackte Tatsachen | Naked Brunch | Buch ohne Weizen\n\n\nNaked oats\nWe only use organic naked oats as oats, as they are particularly rich in nutrients. In contrast to ordinary (husk) oats, they do not need to be heated in order to remove the husk, which saves the enzymes, vitamins and fiber it contains.

Mit der neuen stylischen Flockenquetsche, dem elektrischen YouFlaker.\n\nWolfgang Mock,\nder geniale Getreidem\u00fchlenbauer mit 40 Jahren Erfahrung, hat f\u00fcr uns den YouFlaker entwickelt, zusammen mit Designern der Fachhochschule Darmstadt und dem Team, das vor vielen Jahren schon die legend\u00e4ren Hawo's M\u00fchlen und zuletzt die Mockmill Getreidem\u00fchlen entwickelt hat.\n\nWir, David und Philipp von YouFlake aus Berlin,\nbieten verschiedene M\u00fcsli-Basis-Mischungen und leckere Toppings an \u2013 und jetzt endlich auch einen stylischen Flocker (Flockenquetsche) zum Selbermachen eines wirklich gesunden, frischen M\u00fcsli-Fr\u00fchst\u00fccks. Es geht schnell und ganz einfach, auf Knopfdruck!\n\n\n\nDas Team: David Niermann | Wolfgang Mock | Philipp Roeser\n\n\nUnser Flocker macht bereits tolle Flocken\nUm mit dem YouFlaker in Serie gehen zu k\u00f6nnen, brauchen wir Eure Unterst\u00fctzung. Bisher gibt es ein voll funktionsf\u00e4higes, erprobtes Modell mit allen technischen Komponenten, in einem Geh\u00e4use aus dem 3D-Drucker. Der n\u00e4chste Schritt ist die \u00dcberf\u00fchrung in die Serienproduktion, bei der Kosten f\u00fcr die Erstellung der Gusswerkzeuge (zum Gie\u00dfen des Geh\u00e4uses aus nachwachsenden Rohstoffen, siehe unten) und den Aufbau und die Skalierung der Serienproduktion anfallen. Du hilfst uns mit deinem Beitrag, diese Kosten vorzufinanzieren.\n\n\n\nDer Prototyp des YouFlaker aus dem 3D-Drucker beim Flocken unseres Bio M\u00fcslis\n\n\nVideodemo der Funktionalit\u00e4t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnmerkung: Der Prototyp ist noch etwas kopflastig. Dies wird im Serienprodukt behoben sein durch zwei Gewichte im Fu\u00df.\n\nDoch zuerst: Warum \u00fcberhaupt selber flocken?\nZuerst eine Analogie, die den meisten direkt einleuchtet:\nWer guten Kaffee trinken will, erwartet zu Recht, dass die Kaffeebohnen frisch gemahlen werden, da die frische Verarbeitung den Kaffee einfach besser schmecken l\u00e4sst. Die Aromen kommen besser zur Geltung. Daher wird Kaffee in jedem guten Caf\u00e9 frisch gemahlen und auch privat mahlen immer mehr Menschen ihren Kaffee selber.\n\nGenau das Gleiche gilt bei M\u00fcsli und bei\u00a0Getreide, die zu Flocken verarbeitet werden. Die Frischearomen des Getreides bleiben bei Zubereitung direkt vor dem Verzehr in bester Qualit\u00e4t erhalten. Die Flocken sind im frischen Zustand deutlich saugf\u00e4higer und werden in Fl\u00fcssigkeit schneller weich. Zus\u00e4tzlich zu den Geschmacksaromen - und hier liegt ein Unterschied zum Kaffee - bleiben beim frischen Quetschen von Haferflocken au\u00dferdem wichtige N\u00e4hrstoffe in bester Qualit\u00e4t erhalten. Dazu nun mehr...\n\nWieso also \u00fcberhaupt Hafer selber zu Haferflocken quetschen, wenn man doch auch Haferflocken in jedem Supermarkt kaufen kann?! Was kaum jemand wei\u00df: Industriell hergestellte Haferflocken werden auf \u00a0bis zu 100\u00b0C erhitzt. Zuerst wird der Hafer mit hei\u00dfem Wasserdampf \u00a0behandelt, dann gewalzt und anschlie\u00dfend bei starker Hitze wieder \u00a0getrocknet (gedarrt). Das macht die Haferflocken zwar sehr lange haltbar, aber besch\u00e4digt eben auch viele N\u00e4hrstoffe, vor allem Enzyme und B-Vitamine. Wir haben das anhand des Enzyms Lipase im Labor untersuchen lassen. Die Lipase zerlegt Fette in Ihre Bestandteile. Nur dank ihr kann der K\u00f6rper in der Nahrung erhaltene Fette verdauen sowie eigene Fettreserven zur Energiegewinnung verwenden (Quelle: NetDoktor.de). Enzyme sind sehr hitzeempfindlich und werden schon ab ca. 50\u00b0C irreversibel zerst\u00f6rt. Umso wichtiger ist also die frische Verarbeitung - ohne Erhitzung zur Haltbarmachung. Das gelingt nur mit dem YouFlaker!\n\nEnzymaktivit\u00e4t des Enzyms Lipase in nkat/g\n\n\n\nSource: Lab analysis report, bilacon GmbH, 2019/04/05\n\n\n\u00c4hnlich hitzeempfindlich sind einige der B-Vitamine. Angeschaut haben wir uns die Vitamine B3 (Niacin) und B6 (Pyridoxin). Vitamin B3 ist ein wichtiger Bestandteil der Co-Enzyme NAD und NADH, die dem K\u00f6rper helfen, Energie f\u00fcr den Stoffwechsel zu gewinnen. Es findet sich in s\u00e4mtlichen lebenden Zellen des menschlichen K\u00f6rpers, vor allem in zentralen Organen wie Leber und Nieren und im Fettgewebe. Vitamin B6 spielt ebenfalls eine zentrale Rolle im Stoffwechsel. Es wird vom K\u00f6rper ben\u00f6tigt, um Eiwei\u00dfe umzuwandeln und einzubauen, tr\u00e4gt zur Bildung von Neurotransmittern (Botenstoffen in den Nervenzellen) bei und wirkt sich auf das Immunsystem aus.\n\nB-Vitamine B3 und B6 in \u00b5g\n\n\n\nSource: MRI - Bundesforschungsinstitut f\u00fcr Ern\u00e4hrung und Lebensmittel beim Bundeministerium f\u00fcr Ern\u00e4hrung und Landwirtschaft\n\n\nDas sind die Qualit\u00e4tsunterschiede, die bereits untersucht worden sind. Vermutlich gibt es noch weitere, denn im Hafer sind neben der Lipase zahlreiche andere Enzyme und Vitalstoffe enthalten. Der Punkt ist: Die Frische macht sich einfach bezahlt! Das merkt man bei den N\u00e4hrstoffen und vor allem aber auch beim Geschmack. Viele unserer Kunden berichten uns, dass sie nach dem ersten Mal Selberflocken die fertigen Haferflocken aus dem Supermarkt gar nicht mehr essen m\u00f6chten!\n\nDas betrifft au\u00dferdem nicht nur Hafer, sondern nat\u00fcrlich auch andere Getreidearten wie etwa Dinkel oder Roggen. Frische Flocken schmecken einfach besser!\n\nYouFlaker: Geh\u00e4use aus 100% nachwachsenden Rohstoffen\nF\u00fcr das Geh\u00e4use wird das innovative Material Arboblend\u00ae der schw\u00e4bischen Firma Tecnaro genutzt. Es handelt sich dabei um ein nachhaltiges Material aus 100% nachwachsenden Rohstoffen, das jedoch genauso einfach wie ein Kunststoff in Form gegossen werden kann. Dadurch k\u00f6nnen g\u00fcnstig und trotzdem nachhaltig auch gro\u00dfe Mengen produziert werden. Arboblend\u00ae ist nicht nur besonders nachhaltig, sondern ist auch von der optischen wie haptischen Anmutung deutlich hochwertiger als Kunststoff. Zur Herstellung von Arboblend\u00ae werden die Lignine aus Pflanzenfasern verwendet. Diese bewirken die Verholzung (Lignifizierung) der Pflanzenzellen, sorgen also f\u00fcr die Festigkeit von Holz. Lignin f\u00e4llt in der Papierindustrie als \"Abfallprodukt\" an. Daher steht es ohne weiteren Aufwand kosteng\u00fcnstig in gro\u00dfer Menge zur Verf\u00fcgung. Das Geh\u00e4use besteht also aus Holz, nur eben in Form gegossen und ohne dass daf\u00fcr zus\u00e4tzliches Holz verbraucht wird. Innovativ und ressourcenschonend!\n\nEinfach zu \u00f6ffnen und zu reinigen\nDu kannst das Quetschwerk (mit den beiden Walzen) einfach entnehmen, indem du die obere Abdeckung mit einem Handgriff entfernst und das Quetschwerk anschlie\u00dfend nach vorne herausziehst. Dann kannst du es entweder mit einem Pinsel oder einer kleinen B\u00fcrste (zum Beispiel einer Zahnb\u00fcrste) trocken reinigen. Bei st\u00e4rkeren Ablagerungen l\u00e4sst sich das Quetschwerk auch nass unter flie\u00dfendem Wasser und mit Sp\u00fclmittel reinigen.\n\n\n\nEntriegeln des Oberteils mittels Lasche hinter dem Auslauf\n\n\n\n\n\nAbheben des Oberteils\n\n\n\n\n\nEntnahme des Quetschwerks\n\n\n\n\n\nAusgebautes Quetschwerk mit Edelstahlwalzen\n\n\n\n\n\nTrockenreinigung der Walzen mit einem Borstenpinsel\n\n\n\n\n\nLieferumfang YouFlaker: Flocker mit Motor, Quetschwerk, Oberteil, Deckel, Kaltger\u00e4tekabel\n\n\nUnd als Video...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeistungsf\u00e4higer & sparsamer Elektromotor\nDer Elektromotor hat mehr als gen\u00fcgend Power um spielerisch s\u00e4mtliche Getreidearten (au\u00dfer Mais - zu gro\u00df und zu hart) und \u00d6lsaaten wie etwa Leinsamen, Sonnenblumenkernen, Hanfsamen oder Sesam zu quetschen. So werden alle M\u00fcslizutaten im Nu frisch gequetscht.\n\nLeise\nDas Quetschen geschieht relativ leise. Mit spielerischer Leichtigkeit quetschen die beiden Edelstahlwalzen Getreide und Saaten. Der Motor summt leise und angenehm. H\u00f6rbar, aber man kann sich daneben bequem unterhalten. F\u00fcr die Kenner: Beim Quetschen liegt die Lautst\u00e4rke in etwa bei 60 dB. Das entspricht in etwa der Lautst\u00e4rke beim normalen Sprechen in Zimmerlautst\u00e4rke.\n\n100 Gramm frische Flocken pro Minute\nMit dem YouFlaker stellst du auf Knopfdruck 100 Gramm frische Flocken pro Minute her. Pro Portion mit 50 Gramm dauert es also nur eine halbe Minute bis aus dem ganzen Haferkorn frische Haferflocken geworden sind. Dann noch eines unserer Toppings und je nach Belieben frische Fr\u00fcchte und Beeren sowie (Pflanzen)milch dazugeben - fertig ist das unvergleichlich frische M\u00fcsli.\n\nVon der Designstudie...\nVor dem Prototypen aus dem 3D-Drucker und dem fertigen Serienprodukt standen nat\u00fcrlich die Design-Entw\u00fcrfe auf Papier und am Computer...\n\n\n\nErste Entw\u00fcrfe\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnische Zeichnung\n\n\n\n\n\nDer Entwurf f\u00fcr den stylisher Flocker\n\n\n\n\n\nAnsicht von oben\n\n\n\n\n\nAnsicht von der Seite\n\n\n\n\n\nDer YouFlaker wird bef\u00fcllt\n\n\n\n\n\nFarbspiele\n\n\n\n\n\nEine oder zwei Farben?\n\n\n\n\n\nFarbspiele #2\n\n\n... \u00fcber den Prototyp aus dem 3D-Drucker...\nAlle Fotos sind vom 3D-gedruckten Prototypen gemacht worden.

        "Text": "Motivation\nI'm a passionate developer and I needed a place to host my own applications, a mail server, my website and so on. I wanted full control, so I decided to rent a server, where I could just do all I wanted.\nHowever, in my time managing my own server I came across a few recurring problems:\n\nI changed some configuration and later realize something broke. \u00a0And obviously I don't remember my old settings.\n\u00a0Compatibility between applications. One app requires this version of something, the next one needs another version, one only runs in a new Ubuntu, another only works on an older system, it's a mess.\nUpdating apps can be annoying. When I develop apps, I often want to update the running app with every small change and updating the app usually takes longer than writing the code.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nNow, this was some time ago, and I decided to switch to another server provider. This opens another problem, as there is no way to simply copy and paste my configuration of one server to another.\u00a0\nI definitely am not the only one, so if you're experiencing any of the problems above, I have the solution for you.\nIdea\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, nothing of this is groundbreaking new technology, however it's about combining it all together into an actually useful and most importantly easy to use tool.\nThe solution is to use a combination of git and Docker. Most people reading this far probably know of at least the basic concept of both, but for the remaining ones, here's a little explanation.\nGit is simply a way of saving all changes ever made to files in a directory (called a repository in this case). It's basically like taking snapshots of all the files, and later being able to view or restore any snapshot. Furthermore, it's possible to sync those snapshots to a server, where they can be read from again with any other computer. If we now can compress all configuration of the entire server in one directory we already have two of the problems taken care of: #1 Remembering old settings and #4 Simple transfer of configuration.\nDocker offers a great way to run applications completely independently of each other, solving problem #2 Compatibility between applications. The core concept is similar to a virtual machine, however Docker comes with far less overhead and more performance. And, to complement the first point, there is a way of specifying which applications to run in a text-based form.\nThis only leaves problem #3 Quick and easy updates.\u00a0\nConcept\u00a0\n\n\n\nBasic concept\n\n\nThe basic concept is to store the entire configuration of your server in an online git repository, like GitHub. To set up your server, all you'd have to do is manually run one single command, that would boot up a docker container setting up everything. The container would pull the configuration form the repository and launch all specified applications. Those should contain at the very minimum a service that can be used to replicate updates from the repository.\nGitHub offers a useful feature called Webhooks; when an updated \"snapshot\" is pushed to the repository, it will send a request out to a specified URL. This URL would then be handled by said \u00a0\"update\"-service, pulling the updated configuration and deploying it.\nImplementation\nOpen-Source:\nI'm planning to have every aspect of this project Open Source and available under the GPL v3.0 license, which basically grants everyone the right to use the code for whatever purpose, as long as they keep the source open, use the same license and show a copyright notice.\nModular:\nEvery part of the software that I can reasonably publish as an individual package, I will. This will enable enable anyone to build on which ever part I develop.\nIsolated:\nMy personal aim for this project is not only to solve the above mentioned problems, but also to not touch or rely on the host-system at all. Ideally everything is running in containers and no modifications to the server itself are needed, except for installing Docker. Uninstalling Docker would result in a clean slate, with no relics at all.\nProgress:\nYou can find all progress, as it happens on my GitHub-Account. More detailed information on the progress and technical details can also be found down below.\nThis Kickstarter\n\n\n\n\n\nThe basic project will very likely come together, whether this project is successfully funded or not, just because I personally want to use it.\nThe Kickstarter has the main purpose of gauging the interest in this project and by this potentially funding additional goals:\n1. Improving the quality:\nFunds will be used to further the development, testing, documentation, etc. of the project, to turn it from a niche-hobby project into more of a fully fledged solution.\n2. Add-ons:\nI have some ideas for potential add-ons, that I'd develop only, if there is enough interest. Anyone can suggest add-ons; I will all consider all input I get. As a thank you to higher-pledging supporters, their suggestions will be considered first and might have a lot more influence on the final shape of the project.\n3. My own hosting service:\nShould there be that much interest, that it seems like a feasible option, I will actually take this from a hobby to a professional level, register a company, do whatever is necessary, to create my very own server provider, providing not only servers for rent, with this software pre-installed, but also host a custom repository server, so that all necessary infrastructure would come from one hand. You still would be able to just install\u00a0the software on any other server, it's just less convenient.\nIf you want to see this happen, please share this Kickstarter with anyone that might be interested. I can't afford ads or paying an agency for this project, so it really is up to you to get the stone rolling.\nPotential features\nThis list is neither final, nor exhaustive, nor guaranteed. It serves as inspiration, which features could be implemented with enough funding.\n\nGraphical user interface for configuring the nginx routings\nDetailed server insights using prometheus and grafana\nSupport for referencing applications from other git repositories in the configuration\nTemplates for common applications, like email server, wordpress, password managers, backup solutions, etc.\nMany more\n\nAchievements\nThe barebones for this project have already been implemented:\nAs of the writing of this, already a basic system has been created, that can be updated only by pushing to a GitHub repository. It features nginx in the form of openresty as a proxy and supports forwarding subdomains to individual Docker containers.\nTo see the exact current state of development, see the GitHub repository.\nTo see an up-to-date example of a repository used to configure the deployment, see this \u00a0GitHub repository. Almost everything in there is reusable and I only have to figure the configuration out once; anyone using this software can then copy this configuration to have a working baseline, and only needs to add their own changes.\nAlso, a simple monitoring dashboard for Docker is in the works:\n\nThe basic functions like a overview over all running containers and their state and logs have been implemented.\nMore functions are added as I need them and see fit\nCheck out the GitHub repository for details.\n\nBasic research for the hosting service has begun:\n\nA potential partner company has been established\nFirst sightings of potential hosting solutions\nA more in-depth analysis will follow, when a significant interest in the project has been established\n\nArtifacts\nA list of all the small packages that were developed in the context of this project, but can be used on their own. This list will be updated as soon as something new is available.\nNode.js\n\n\u00a0express-git-hook: A npm package, that offers a middleware for dealing with GitHubs webhooks\n\u00a0express-sync-state: A npm package, providing tools for synchronizing a state object from the express server to all connected clients\n\nDocker\n\n\u00a0docker-monitor: The above mentioned monitoring dashboard for Docker.\n"

But you mostly never seen them, since they are boxed inside the device.\nBut why, though? When you look at them closely, you can fall in love with their beauty: structured, complex, stuffed with components... For many of us, as children, they looked like small futuristic city models!\nOf course, their purpose is not to be pretty. Yet, when you take the time to design one, you can easily add drawings and, if you are creative enough, make it a piece of art!\nThat was the clever idea of L\u00e9o Giroud, Master student in physics. He likes to prototype and play with PCBs, and wants to bring them in your keychain, on your bags and clothes!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Our goal is to create an online shop to sell our PCBs. They are decorative gadgets, to be used as pins, keychains, necklace, etc.\u00a0\nThey exists in two flavours:\n\nsimple PCB without component. The design is printed on the board itself during the manufacturing proccess. We play with the different layers of the PCB to create different colors and shades!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0luminescent PCB with leds and battery, they shine bright when you press the button with a special light animation!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this campain, we've made a dozen of early designs. A very small quantity is already available in our Etsy shop. This campain will allow us to fund a first stock of these PCB and to develop our online shop. So that we would be able to work on new designs freely!\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter sketching the PCB, we make the PCB design out of it on a special computer software. This process is technical and requires basic knowledge in electronics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the PCB is ready, we order all of them to our manufacturer that will create the PCB for us. This process can be long as two weeks, depending on the amount and colors of the PCBs.\u00a0\nWhen we receive them, we have to prepare them: soldering all the components for the luminescents ones mostly. After this, they are ready to be shipped to you!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe project is held by a single person: L\u00e9o G. (it's me!)\nI am 22, currently a master student in physics. But it seems that I have lots of other interests, such as DIY crafts, electronics, and -of course- PCBs!\nI am in charge of the realisation of the designs, the creation of the PCB and all of the soldering stuff. I will most likely remain the only working individual in this project!\nIn a close future I hope to be helped for graphish and communication by my friend, Gabriela P. This project would not have existed without her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur estimation is currently at 2500\u20ac for three main things:\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we reach our goal, the leftovers will be used for the creation of an official business!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou just have to order the first counterpart and choose the PCB that you would like to have in the add-ons.\u00a0\nAlso, for counterparts higher than 15\u20ac, you will receive a \"thank you\" special campain PCB where your nickname will be displayed on it (if you want to)!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeel free to check out our Etsy shop! before the campain end, to see all the designs available in details. Also check our Instagram, our \u00a0Facebook or our \u00a0Twitter!\nYour support for our project is vital and we thank you from the bottom of our hearts. Your help is the key to make this project reality. We are eager to see you wear our pins!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "Text": "\n\n\n\n\nHave you ever felt bored or tired looking at string lights? This is because normal string lights have a simple and systemic pattern that splits the bulbs into two groups that flash alternatively.\nCan you feel the difference between the two videos below?\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth show trees decorated with string lights of 200 light bulbs. Conventional string lights splits up the flicker of its lights so that 100 turn on when the other 100 are off. Then they just interchange the state of being on and off.\n\n\n\n\n\nlumi.art, on the other hand, is a state-of-the-art string lights that embeds a semiconductor chip in each LED, allowing move independently and control the mood to your liking through mobile app. If you take a moment, you\u2019ll see that none of them blink at the same time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsers can even create their own patterns and sequences in the app. See them appear on lumi.art in real time.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe smartphone app supports both iOS and Android and can be downloaded for free from the App Store or Play Store.\nUsing the app, you can not only edit real-time patterns, but also edit, save, and share sequences, and schedule operation times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse lumi.art in various moods and places or as part of your own arts and craft. We leave it up to you to get creative!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNone of the lights blink the same way. They flicker independently and randomly. Then by editing the frequency and brightness through the app, users can create their own patterns and sequences. It\u2019s almost like you can create your own set of beautiful stars in the night sky.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0How is this twinkling possible?\nBy embedding semiconductor chips in all LEDs, it creates a twinkle pattern that make each of them blink individually. This simply cannot be imitated by string lights out there today. It\u2019s a patented technology that we\u2019re proud to hold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe provide 8 pre-set light patterns for a variety of moods with lumi.art. You can also create your own patterns with your smartphone app.\nThe example video below show a combination of 400 steady lights and 200 LEDs lumi.art on a Christmas tree.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample pattern - 1 : Energetic night\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis pattern resembles a dynamic atmosphere that matches the energetic music of the club with quick-blinking LEDs.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample pattern - 2 : Pouring stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis pattern resembles twinkling stars in a quiet night sky with select LEDs that fade out while most stay on.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample pattern - 3 : Mellow fog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis pattern embodies the image of emerging water mist by dimming up and down the LEDs one at a time.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample pattern - 4 : Roaring bonfire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis pattern creates the feeling of a crackling bonfire by having the LEDs flicker off very quickly and turn back on.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample pattern - 5 : Hopeful waiting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis pattern gives a comfortable yet slightly urgent feeling by gently turning the LED on and off, so we named it \"Hopeful waiting\".\n\n\n\n\n\nExample pattern - 6 : Nostalgic love\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe slow frequency at which the LEDs fade in and out conveys reminiscent feelings of a long-past lover.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample pattern - 7 : Flourishing desire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis pattern is named \"flourishing desire\" because like our aspirations in life, the LEDs are quick to grow and spread.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample pattern - 8 : Fading memories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike the pattern right before, LEDs in \"Fading memories\" turn on slowly and turn off quickly, reminding us that even the fondest of memories don't last forever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA natural tendency of the human brain is to find patterns and stability in everything we do. This is instinctive because we require natural regularities like knowing that the sun will rise every day and lions going out to hunt in order to survive. Predictability is great but it requires our brain to process a heavy amount of visual information, often causing overload and burn-out.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, when you see random movements of nature, such as sparks fluttering in the fireplace, leaves swaying in the wind, or waves glistening in the sunlight, you feel at peace and relaxed.\nThis is because the brain gives up trying to find regularity in such movements and accepts the beauty of nature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0lumi.art has 8 blinking patterns built-in, so the default patterns are automatically operated at default intervals without connecting to the app. \u00a0Also, the USB type transmitter has a button, which can be pressed to manually switch the pattern.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you connect with the app and send a pattern or sequence edited in the app, it will work with that thereafter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to reinventing the versatility and beauty of string lights, lumi.art is challenging many other aspects of the existing string lights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated delivery : Jul 2022\nShips to : Anywhere in the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelieve it or not, the idea behind lumi.art goes back 30 years. Looking at the string lights I always see around Christmas season, I kept thinking that the blinking pattern was too monotonous and mechanical. I thought, \u201chow amazing would it be to have all the bulbs twinkle individually?\u201d And that\u2019s how lumi.art was born.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem was that when the idea was implemented, the product was too expensive. However, due to the rapid progress of semiconductor technology in recent years, the price has come down to a level that can be commercialized. With more affordable semiconductors, we were able to apply for a patent five years ago and refine our technology ever since.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlumi.art team\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur vision\nAs for next steps, I want lumi.art to completely change the way we see and use string lights. The twinkle pattern of string lights has stayed the same for the past 100 years. I think it\u2019s finally time to challenge that \u2013 from mechanical and monotonous light patterns to a true source of art.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs one of the first crowdfunding marketing agencies,\u00a0Enventys Partners\u00a0has brought more than 750 crowdfunding projects to life through lead generation, campaign page creation, public relations, email marketing, Facebook Advertising, campaign management and more."

I was born and raised in Azerbaijan where I have started my career in marketing communications at Omnicom media group.\u00a0\nI moved to Spain to pursue my MBA together with my 3 years old daughter, and after graduation, I joined a company in Madrid and have been consulting tech startups for 2 years. During that time I was actively using dating apps. That's when I started to notice how dating apps made me feel. First, of all, they consumed my time, I had to swipe and talk to several people at once for getting one date. And then once I went on a date I found out that people either don't look or behave the same way. And my time was wasted, my self-confidence was weakening with every date.\u00a0I have met some nice people who later became my friends, but I could not meet anyone with whom I could be aligned. And I realized that the only dating app that I would use is the one that can help me to meet with real people around in a live mode, while I do what I enjoy, without going on pre-arranged dates or spending hours looking on my screen.\u00a0\nThat's how Blink was born.\u00a0\nBlink allows users to present in the same venue to match, chat, play games, and meet instantly.\u00a0With a special feature, you can select the place to go or tag yourself in your favorite spot and see who is around. If you find your perfect match, agree to meet instantly and have a chat.\u00a0\nWe want to eliminate time and energy wasted on dating apps and give our users an opportunity to experience live encounters. our app is not niche, it's inclusive as it does not depend on your sexual preferences, which you can easily filter, it depends on your lifestyle and places you like to attend.\u00a0\nAnd our goal is to offer a completely new experience, not engage users with the app. We will be happy if users leave the app for a good reason.\u00a0\nWe have already finalized the MVP and we want to develop app further, add new features and have a marketing budget to promote the app.\u00a0\nEven if you can't contribute to the funding, we would be happy to see you on our waiting list."

Instead, most people see their dog as a part of the family, so they can also use the couch, right?\n\nAd Greaves, the inventor of Petaway also sees his dogs as part of the family and gives them a dog bed to sleep in. A nice spot meant for them alone. Next to that, he taught his dogs not to go on the couch, without complicated dog training.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAd Greaves, the inventor of Petaway, has taught his dogs not to go on the couch unless he invited them explicitly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is what he found out. As soon as he left the house, his dogs would still find their favorite spot: the couch! They know it\u2019s not allowed, but they secretly do it anyway. One of his dogs is so clever that she quickly jumps off the couch and lays down in her basket when she hears him coming home. Unfortunately, she is not wise enough to first remove all the hairs she has left behind.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, he thought, I\u2019ll put some dining chairs on the couch before we leave. To find out when he got home that that was no problem at all for the dogs. Instead, they maneuver easily between the legs of the chairs for a well-deserved afternoon nap.\nPutting the seat cushions upright to make it difficult for the dogs to lie on the couch also had little effect. They simply took their place on the stretched fabric and even took the springs for granted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHow can I make sure that every time I leave home, I don\u2019t have to make a mess of half my house to keep my dogs from going on the couch,\u201d he thought. \u201cWithout hindering my dog\u2019s freedom of movement, so they can go anywhere, except for the couch. Or on the bed or on a chair. Wherever I trained them not to go.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe discussed his idea with Electronic Engineer Hans van Leeuwen, founder of Sostark and Designer Hans Pols, founder of Barite, who are both fellow pet lovers. A lot of brainstorm sessions later, the team found a simple but effective solution.\n\n\n\nLeft to right: Hans van Leeuwen, Electronic Engineer  |  Ad Greaves, Inventor  |  Hans Pols: Designer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the first ideas had sensitive antennas. These would extend and tuck into the corners of your couch. If the dog would sit on the couch and touch one of the antennas, the alarm in the device would be activated. Indeed not a bad idea, but cumbersome, with those antennas. But the idea for a high-frequency sound was already born here!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo get rid of the antennas, the team had to look for an alternative detection technique. Infrared was not an option because that would restrict the dog\u2019s freedom of movement. A sensor on the dog\u2019s collar that would trigger the device when the dog was close was also not a good idea. The dog simply wouldn\u2019t understand where that noise suddenly came from if it came near the couch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen the idea came to us! What we need is a sensor that detects the vibration of the sofa, indicating that the dog is doing something that is not allowed.\nWith this new idea in mind, Hans, our technical engineer, set to work and put together the first prototype. And it worked right away! The sensor was sensitive enough to convert a shock from the couch or surface it was lying on into a signal. Bingo!\n\n\n\nFirst prototype with the sensor which detects pet's movement.\n\n\n\nNow we've got something that will make a difference!\u00a0\nWith this, we created a handy device that you only have to switch on and off and place on your couch, chair, or bed. The dog can move freely through the room, and the sensor ensures that it corrects the dog with the sound at the right time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe square version at the top left still has the appearance of our first design, but now without extendable antennas.\n\nTo make Petaway even more sensitive to the detection of even the slightest vibration, we have given the housing a curve, which allows the device to wobble.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWubbo, our draftsman, has transformed Hans\u2019 line sketches into a model where all necessary parts got a place. With this model, we were able to make prototypes on a 3D printer.\n\n\n\n\nThe first 3D prints we painted by hand to match our brand identity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest 1 - Sensitivity of the sensor\nWith the first sensitivity test, we wanted to determine whether the device also works on large sofas with different loose seat cushions when the dog jumps on one of them. We simulated such a situation in the following video.\n(The hissing sound you hear when Petaway is active is a side effect of recording on an iPhone. In real life, only the dog hears the high-pitched tone).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest 2 - How do dogs react to it?\nEverything runs smoothly! Now we are going to take the ultimate test. How will the dogs react to it? We placed a camera near the sofa in the homes of our test dogs. As soon as the camera detects movement, it records image and sound.\u00a0\n\nWe gave the dog owner the following simple instructions:\nMake sure your dog is calm and at ease. Introduce the device to the dog by holding it in your hand and turning it on. Your dog will withdraw from the noise. This technique will condition your dog. It\u2019s impressed by something new, something unknown, while you hold it in your hand and knows not be frightened by it.\u00a0\nConditioning your dog this way, we believe that the dog will immediately withdraw from its action when it hears the sound again by applying this technique. Thus, he associates it with the owner the next time he hears this sound. Because the dog knows that going on the couch is prohibited, the unique sound becomes an extension of the owner.\n\nWith Petaway on the couch, the dogs are alone in the room. Now, wait and see what happens.\n\nEllis puts Petaway to the test at night\nIn the following video, you see dog Ellis. She is never allowed on the couch but secretly does so at night.

        "Text": "\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Octopus?\nOctopus is a sun-like light source for indoor plants, thanks to its full-spectrum LEDs. \u00a0These LEDs stimulate plant growth and give you the opportunity to achieve better growth at home. You just need to put your plant under Octopus and turn it on. Thanks to the Wi-Fi connectivity, you can set up your Octopus very quickly and easily. With the help of an integrated camera and e-mail application, you can observe your plants from wherever you are located. Thus, your plants will never wilt and the progress will always be under your control.\n\n\n\nPlants under Octopus\n\n\n\u00a0Features of Octopus\n\nOctopus light covers the full spectrum of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR). Octopus not only stimulates plant growth but also eliminates the undesirable energy consumption on the spectrum.\nThanks to the high-efficiency LEDs, Octopus is much more efficient than the classical grow bulbs.\nOctopus has a manual dimming function that allows the users to adjust the level of light easily.\nOctopus has a \u00a0thermal control function that keeps the temperature of the LEDs constant. This also helps extend the life of the LEDs.\nOctopus is made up of durable high-quality stainless material and so it can offer an extended service life.\nOctopus has a reliable function to protect the user and the device itself.\nOctopus requires no maintenance.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFeatures you can find only in Octopus\nOctopus is a smart Grow Led System \u00a0(GLS) that has many new features that are being introduced to the grow-led industry by the Octopus Team.\u00a0\n\nOctopus has a Photosynthetically Active Radiation \u00a0(PAR) sensor that measures the level of light in the environment and adjusts the light level automatically. This feature not only saves energy but also extends the life of the LEDs.\nOctopus has a timer function that turns on/off the light automatically at scheduled times. This feature helps the users maintain the optimum illumination for their plants.\u00a0\nOctopus has an integrated camera that helps the user observe the plants.\nBy using the e-mail application, the user can receive photos of the plants and the status of the Octopus.\n\n\n\n\nLEDs and Integrated camera on Octopus\n\n\nWhat you can grow with Octopus\nWith Octopus, you can grow various plants at home. \u00a0Below are a few examples:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenefits of Octopus\n\n\nHow you can grow with Octopus\nWith Octopus, you can grow almost any plant in your home, from seed to full harvest.\u00a0In this section, you will find a brief introduction to how you can do this. A more detailed guide will be provided with the product.\n\nFirst of all, you need to decide on what you want to grow. You can select from a variety of vegetables, fruits, salad greens, herbs, or plants. You can search on the web to make a decision. The following can be a good starting point here.\u00a0\nYou will need a proper-sized pot and enough soil to cover the seeds. The seeds and necessary equipment can be found in supermarkets, flower shops, and online.\nYou should find an appropriate place in your home to locate the Octopus. If you choose a location close to a window, that will assist with energy saving by using the automatic dimming function of Octopus. Growing tents with reflective material are available for additional purchase.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can start by hanging your Octopus and then attach your plant. The height can be adjusted according to the light requirement of the plant. As you adjust the Octopus closer to the plant, the illumination will increase but the total area illuminated will decrease.\n\n\n\n\nAdjustable hanging mechanism of Octopus\n\n\n\nOctopus has a local user interface that helps the grower control the main functions of the device simply.\u00a0Using this interface, you can adjust the light level, start-stop timer, and enable-disable the automatic dimming. The local user interface can also show status from Octopus such as internal temperature, hours left to switch on/off using the timer, and the light sensor readings.\n\n\n\n\nCAD of Local User Interface\n\n\n\n\u00a0Octopus has a web interface for the users to manage the functions in a more controlled manner.\u00a0The following video shows how to connect your PC to the Octopus web server. The web server can also be connected from a smartphone. The web interface gives full access to the functions of Octopus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe light needed for your plant may change throughout its life. Therefore, you may need to change the light level produced by Octopus. You can do that through both local and web interfaces of Octopus.\nThe timer function of Octopus helps you realize the lighting r requirement of your plant. \u00a0The timer can be started-stopped through the local user interface or can be set up more precisely through the web interface.\nIf you enable the automatic dimming option, this will automatically adjust the level of light produced by Octopus. Additionally, it helps you save energy. While the threshold can be set to only two values: 1 Klux (overcast day) or 10 Klux (full day-light) by using the local user interface, It can be set to any value with a resolution of 1 Klux through the web interface. Octopus implements a fuzzy-control technique while dimming the light automatically and does not respond to accidental environmental changes in light.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use the e-mail application of Octopus to receive photos and updates.

The LEDs on the board have been selected to provide the optimum growth light to match the spectrum of the light produced to the PAR spectrum.\u00a0\nThe aluminum heat sink transfers the heat generated by the LEDs to the air with the help of cooling fans.\u00a0\nThe LED driver is the component that provides the LEDs with electric energy. It is a high-quality, high-efficiency, long-life driver.\nThe power supply provides electricity to the Control Unit. The control unit houses the control board and Wi-Fi module.\u00a0The control board and Wi-Fi module allow the firmware and software of Octopus to function.\n\nDevelopment of Octopus\nThe spectrum of the light that is needed by plants is called Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) and the shape of this spectrum is of great importance for the grow light design. The design of Octopus is based on studies to understand the Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) spectrum. With the design of \u00a0Octopus, we have made several simulations to test and determine the optimum LED arrangement for the generation of the PAR.\n\n\n\nPAR Spectrum (left) and  Simulation of light density of Octopus\n\n\n\u00a0The Octopus Technology Team has designed hardware and firmware/software components to maximize the user-friendliness functions. Integration of these components has developed two prototypes of Octopus.\u00a0\n\n\n\nA section from Octopus hardware design\n\n\nDesign Iterations\nEven though many iterations have been tried at the components level during the design of Octopus, \u00a0Octopus has only two prototypes. The necessary modifications have been done on the first prototype to improve the power supply and the Wi-Fi module of Octopus. Moreover, a cover has also been designed and integrated into Octopus to enhance its appearance. The below pictures show the prototypes and modifications.\n\n\n\nFirst prototype (left), modification work (right) and second prototype (below)\n\n\nLED Board Design\nThe LED board is one of the main components of the Octopus. It is supporting and feeding the LEDs, which produce light for the plants. Below you can see the prototypes of the LED board on which the Octopus Team has conducted some tests and made modifications.\n\n\n\nLED Board iterations (second prototype on the left, first prototype on the right)\n\n\nTests of Octopus\nVarious tests have been conducted on Octopus. Some of the performed tests are explained under the following topics.\nIllumination Performance Test\nOctopus can generate up to \u00a070000 lux at a distance of 30 cm at 110 watts of input power. This value is twice the amount that direct sunlight gives and seven times the amount of full daylight (not direct sunlight). Please see the table below for illuminance from various sources.\n\n\n\nIlluminance (src: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lux)\n\n\nThe video shows the maximum illuminance from Octopus at a distance of 30 cm at steady-state.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLight meter showing the illuminance in Lux - the actual value is 100 times the displayed value for the selected range.

We believe that hand washing can be made fun, and bring joy to our young ones every single day.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nKids refusing to wash their hands? We believe that hand washing shouldn't be a chore; and it definitely shouldn't be something that we have to keep nagging about.\n\n\n\n\n\nHandwashing is extremely important for our young ones. As they play and explore our world by touch, they collect a significant amount of dirt and germs on their hands everyday.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, we asked ourselves: What if parents did not have to constantly nag and remind their children to wash their hands? What if hand washing was so fun they could clean up after themselves, every day, and have a great time doing so?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuru-buru is a motion activated dispenser that instantly converts any foaming handsoap into a cloud of bubbles. With buru-buru, every handwash becomes a fun, engaging experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuru-buru's ample bubble clouds offer much better coverage over palms and backs of hands - approximately about 3x more surface area coverage than your average soap dispenser.\nBased on testing estimates, Buru-buru uses only about half the soap required per effective hand wash as compared to conventional soap dispensers!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo refill, simply pop off the lid, remove the screw cap, and pour in your favourite foaming handsoap!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuru-buru is compatible with most foaming hand soaps, and has been tested with soaps from the sample brands above. Non-foaming hand soaps also work with a 1:1 water to soap dilution ratio!\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Buru-buru\u2019s pledges do not include shipping costs. We will be using Easyship's post-campaign backer management platform to manage and charge shipping before sending out the Buru-buru orders. We will strive to offer the best, optimised shipping costs for each country based on our shipping partner estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there! Buru-buru is run by a team of 3 passionate industrial designers. It is a labour of love and toil - and countless hours of playing with bubbles. Our adventure began in August 2021, when the three of us sat down to talk about a possible Kickstarter project. We found that we had something truly special in the idea of applying bubbles - otherwise novel, ethereal, fun playthings - to practical contexts and use cases. Buru-buru was born - a dream to create a soap dispenser that could turn any ordinary handsoap into bubbles instantly. After hundreds of hours of design work, one too many cups of coffee, and approximately 98430 popped bubbles later (we didn't actually count), we are on the cusp of launching buru-buru on Kickstarter!\n\u200b\nHelp us make Buru-buru a reality, and make hand washing something magical that kids can look forward to. \u2728\n\u200b\n\u2764\ufe0f Follow us on Instagram!\u00a0\n\u2764\ufe0f Check out our cool website!\u00a0\n\nWith love, and lots of bubbles,\n-- Team buru-buru\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The back is overloaded by the harness?\nWe have the perfect solution for you.\n*Note that the campaign has many gifs. Wait for them to load fully.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe present the first modular pants available on the market, designed for people working with the camera in the field. Our product replaces a standard photographic backpack, thanks to which it increases the mobility and comfort of the photographer and relieves the back during work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can adapt the pants to your requirements. You can mount only a camera on them, but also a camera, a second lens, and a bag for filters and batteries.\nAre you left-handed? No problem, both sides are symmetrical, the camera can rest on the left or right hip.\nHave a problem with your left ankle? Take the pressure off your leg and buckle all heavy items on your right hip. When you recover, replace the mounts in the previous place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe load capacity is 2.5 kg (tested in off-road running). Plate can handle both a small compact camera and a SLR with a long lens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe regural/slim fit can be worn both in the city and in the field. Pants go well with the outdoor sweatshirt, but also with an elegant shirt or everyday clothes.\nThe men's and women's versions are adapted to the body shape, and the legs are tapered downwards, which ensures comfort and a good look\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPants designed especially for photographers to fulfill their modular task and at the same time be minimalist and imperceptible. As a model we used the best solutions from the military industry and motocross clothing,\n\n\n\n\n\nThe top of the pants is the most important for us. It is equipped with wide belt loops up to 50 mm wide and a 50 mm elastic and reinforced belt. On the inside, at the height of the fasteners, carrying straps are sewn in, which evenly distribute the weight.\n\n\n\n\n\nPants are made of elastic fabric with a special weave \u2022 Nylon / Cotton Ripstop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe material is waterproof and breathable at the same time, so you stay comfortable in the worst conditions.\n\u2022 Material: 50% Polyester, 22% Cotton, 22% Nylon, 6% Elastane\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most important element \"the mount\", was made of two elements: a military buckle and a special Velcro that holds the camera in place. In addition, you can attach special foams underneath, which will protect you from abrasions and injuries, and will evenly distribute the weight of the camera on the leg.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur rail meets classic standards and can be used interchangeably with manfrotto plates (577). It additionally includes protection against accidental unplugging.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mounting strength has been field tested.\nThe mount can withstand running, jumping, cycling and all outdoor activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand even this ...\nPhotographer: Hey, I wanna check something out, can I?\nus: Yeah, no problem.\nAlso us: ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "Text": "At Loolla, we believe that learning is not just about collecting scrolls, certificates or badges. \u00a0And whilst there are skills and knowledge to be learnt from the accomplished masters, experts and academia, there is much to be learned as well from the have-beens, the experienced, the explorer, hobbyist, the doers and even learners. Fundamentally, the real value of learning is the direct, relevant and positive impact on one's life - beyond who delivers it. \u00a0\n\nPlease click on the link to get the slide deck on About Loolla.\n\n\n\nWith One Account, Members Can Be Both Learner and Trainer / Tutor / Instructor\n\n\n\n\n\nLoolla started out as a project by a dad wanting to better help the learning of his young school-going children.\u00a0 Whilst social messaging platforms are now commonly used these days to aid in learning, they can be disruptive, disorganised and inadvertently divert the focus away from the learning process itself. \u00a0 He simply wanted to create a better option - beyond the disruptive messaging platforms - for his young schooling children to safely connect with the online learning community; to learn from those who know or have-been there and to share their knowledge and abilities with the world when they are ready for it.\n\n\n\nOnline learning is more than just watching fancy videos, consuming interactive content or obtaining online badges and certificates. \u00a0\n\nBe it about solving a maths problem from school, working on a group assignment, performing a task, picking up a new hobby or building a skillset; many of us - young and old -\u00a0 inevitably depend on a network of people who provide useful guidance and wisdom that support our learning and discovery. Without this network, it can be difficult sometimes to locate, reach, sieve through and understand the information, answers and guidance we seek.\n\n\n\n\u00a0Your learning network is the multiplier that amplifies your learning. \u00a0\nWhilst there are many messaging platforms out there for communication and exchanges, and a multitude of online learning courses, one is hard press to find a tool that can easily build and grow an individual's personal learning network to support learning and discovery over time. A personal learning network (or PLN, in short) is a dedicated space, where one can easily initiate, participate in and spread learning of ideas, knowledge, skills, wisdom, experience, tools and tips.\n\nWith Loolla, you can easily build, grow and develop your personal learning network - with relevant people, on different subject matters, at your own time and in your own pace. \u00a0\n\n\n\nLoolla brings together the useful features of communication technologies that allow online group formation, interactions and sharing, with the power of learning management systems that allow you to create, publish and sell online courses.\u00a0 With Loolla you can :\n\n\nCreate online learning groups\nParticipate in learning discussions\nCreate online courses\nShare your online courses\nSell your online courses\nConnect your online groups with your courses\nReceive and award digital certificates\nTrack your learners/students progress\nView your course earnings\n\n\nCarry your personal learning network with you, always. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessible via desktop and mobile devices, you carry your personal learning network all the time with Loolla. You can chat with your group members or create your own course whilst on-the-go. Explore the groups and forums that interest you and join the discussion anytime convenient for you.\n\n\nYou'll learn when you interact\nYou'll learn when you do\nYou'll learn when you teach\n\nEver encounter having difficulty tracking or finding the \"thread of conversations\" or \"shared content\" over social messaging platforms. More often than not, you have to spend some time scrolling through the list of messages and conversation's threads to find the message or thread that you are looking for. With Loolla, you can easily go to the relevant groups and discussion forums or courses to get to it. Social messaging platforms are good for quick communication, but they are not meant to be your repository of learning resources and to grow your learning network. Loolla helps you achieve both.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you are in Loolla, you are in a pure learning zone.\nAttach learning resources such as links, media and documents for your course learners/students or group members and have them easily accessible.\nLoolla does not seek to replace the spectrum of online courses or online forums that are already out there designed for structured and formal learning.\n\nLoolla embraces the fact that learning is a social process. \u00a0\nLoolla accepts learning for what it is\u00a0 - a social process.\u00a0 We give recognition to the fact that in this digital age, Everybody Can Learn From Everyone and Anybody Can Teach Anyone.\n\nYou don't have to be a professor or an expert to teach the world.\nYou don't have to be a pro to start a group and learning forum.\n\n\nTEACHERS. TUTORS. INSTRUCTORS. COACHES. MENTORS\n\u00a0\u00a0Teach and guide on-the-go \u00a0\n\nCreate a learning group and share learning content online through the Course Creator.\nCommunicate as a group or one-on-one through private messages with your students, coachee and mentees.\nConduct an online virtual meet within Loolla.\nSell your ONLINE and ONSITE course or offer them for free\nSet your course or tuition fees to be recurring or one-time payment\nLink your tuition class or group(s) to your course or tuition programme\nSchedule events in your course / tuition group\n\nGROUP ASSIGNMENTS.

Throughout my college journey I've always had the idea of doing something big. I wanted to showcase my creativity, but also set the tone thinking outside the box. I fell in love with technology as I became obsessed with reaching my goal. I planned to write a book but I said to myself, how valuable would I be if I gave people something they could start and finish? So I decided to deliver who I am as a creator in a way that could live forever. It may seem complicated but overall I'm just a kid from a small town Kinston, NC. The youngest of 6 siblings and always felt the coolest no matter who I was around or where I was at. For some odd reason I began networking in college expanding the idea of who I wanted to become.\u00a0Today I am presenting everyone with Cool People Network. My Blog was designed to present education over entertainment because I wanted to change the narrative. Anything is possible if you surround yourself with right people and change your mindset when it comes to success.

        "Text": "Booka Local Language barrier app between foreigners and Native German speakers and Pro Bono Services to international visitors who are sexually assaulted in Germany.\n\nHi, I'm Mei Chi Lo, the creator of the Booka Local app, knows all too well the challenges non-German speakers face when navigating various processes. I was sexually assaulted in Germany and found it difficult to file a report due to language barriers. I got the support needed through the help of my German fianc\u00e9 that bridges the language barrier. \u00a0I also faced other daily challenges as a non-native German speaker living in the country, such as speaking to customer service representatives. Thus, I got a challenging spirit to put these traumatic and frustrating experiences to work for a positive cause\u2014creating a service that connects people looking for help navigating language barriers with local helpers who speak the language and understand German bureaucracy.\nBooka Local App\nBooka Local website was launched in November 2020 in Germany. Via the site, international visitors and immigrants who may not speak German proficiently can request assistance with various tasks that may require translation. Some services that helpers can provide are making phone calls with utility companies, scheduling appointments, and filling out bureaucratic paperwork such as visa applications. The site has gained traction and overwhelmingly positive reviews since its launch nearly a year ago. Because of Booka Local\u2019s popularity, the team is now focusing on launching and marketing its app, giving users access to local language helpers at the tip of their fingers.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Booka Local\nCompleting tasks that require communication can be difficult and frustrating for millions of people living in and visiting countries where they may not speak the local language proficiently. Booka Local, a new translation services app available in Germany, is looking to give non-native German speakers a way to break through language barriers by connecting them with locals who speak German. Once connected to a language helper, the user can get the translation assistance needed to complete a wide variety of tasks that otherwise may be difficult due to limited language skills.\nBooka Local users pay an hourly fee to their helpers for assistance via the platform. But one selling point of the app is that the rates offered by Booka Local helpers are far less than those of professional translators. The Booka Local team also takes great care to ensure the safety of their customers by screening the local helpers carefully before making their services available on the platform. And for those looking to be helpers, the team also takes utmost care in ensuring their personal safety and that their feedback is heard and taken into consideration. All the local helpers are insured by Booka Local.\n\u201cIn creating Booka Local, I wanted to deliver something impactful that would ensure that international visitors or immigrants with limited German language skills could avoid the frustrations and embarrassments I experienced in trying to navigate everyday life and government bureaucracies.\n\n\n\nBooka Local App\n\n\nPro Bono Services\nI wanted to be sure that no other sexual assault survivors have to experience roadblocks with navigating bureaucratic and legal processes because of language barriers. That\u2019s why Booka Local offers pro-bono services to international visitors who are sexually assaulted in Germany. They can now secure the needed translation support to file the appropriate reports. We help the victims navigate the language-related procedures such as filing a police report, for free.\nServices available on Booka Local\n\nPhone calls in German\nAppointments at government offices\nPaperwork\n\nAs it takes time to learn a foreign language, we step in and provide those having troubles with the German language by providing language-related services like attending appointments, phone calls, or even document checking.\nOur Ebook\nOne of our main goals is to help internationals integrate within German society. That is why we have also been working on producing an ebook with questions we asked the locals. We plan to distribute these to the internationals for free so that they have a better idea of how the locals think or what they would normally do in certain situations. We want to break the stereotypes internationals might have about the Germans and the German culture.\nWhy Crowdfunding?\nMy team has dedicated our services to a good cause in bridging the language barriers but we need to improve this app usage because, what is worth doing, is worth doing well.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Better Booka local App development and improvement: Simple version of the app has been launched thus we the need to upgrade and fix some bugs and also some features planned to be developed to improve the remote language assistance.\n\u00a0Expanding to other cities or countries: Currently, Booka Local in-person service is only available in Berlin. We have received great recommendations and feedbacks to extend this services to other cities like Hamburg, Leipzig, Frankfurt am Main and so on.\n\u00a0Pro-bono services: On average, people who receive our free help need 2hour assistance and these local helpers are paid by Booka local and which we didn't set limit on the hours we offer to those in need.\n\nHelp us achieve the best version of Booka local and Pro-bono services.\nThank you"

Hace dos a\u00f1os, tras pasar por un momento complicado en mi vida, y con ese sentimiento de soledad a flor de piel, surgi\u00f3 una idea que se apoder\u00f3 de m\u00ed:\u00a0\nLa soledad es algo que todos hemos sufrido alguna vez de una forma o de otra, y con todos los medios de los que hoy en d\u00eda disponemos, el sentimiento de soledad es cada vez mayor en la sociedad actual.\nPor ello me aventur\u00e9 a crear Nade, una red social en la que los usuarios pueden hablar sobre sus inquietudas, sus problemas, sus experiencias... Un lugar donde encontrar a gente que les entienda y que les pueda ayudar, al igual que ellos podr\u00e1n ayudar a otros.\nEl lema de Nade es \"Todos tenemos algo que contar\", y es prec\u00edsamente porque todos tenemos nuestras experiencias, vivencias, conocimientos... Y por eso cada uno de nosotros puede aportar algo a alguien en un momento dado, como tambi\u00e9n le puede aportar algo otra persona en otro momento. Y gracias a la tecnolog\u00eda, esa persona puede estar en tu misma calle, en tu misma ciudad, o al otro lado del oc\u00e9ano.\nEl objetivo de Nade es crear una comunidad en la que los usuarios sientan que no est\u00e1n solos, que los problemas que ellos tienen, los tienen otras personas o los han tenido en alg\u00fan momento de sus vidas. Que tengan la tranquilidad de saber que hay un lugar donde se pueden desahogar, donde pueden preguntar esas cosas que a veces no se atreven, y donde pueden ayudar a otras personas, porque la sensaci\u00f3n que te da haber ayudado a alguien es de completa plenitud, y es algo que muchas veces olvidamos y que nos llena por completo.\n\nPor otra parte, el proyecto ya est\u00e1 lanzado desde hace unos 4 meses. Hay m\u00e1s de 4.000 usuarios entre Espa\u00f1a y los pa\u00edses hispanohablantes, y el feedback que recibimos es en su gran mayor\u00eda muy positivo. Mucha gente afirma que es una App necesaria.\n\nEl proyecto ha supuesto cerca de 100.000\u20ac de inversi\u00f3n, todo ello ha sido abordado con presupuesto personal, que fue invertido en el desarrollo de la App y de la web, y en la elaboraci\u00f3n de planes de marketing y ventas.\nLos fondos recaudados ser\u00e1n empleados en algunas ampliaciones en el desarrollo (20% de los fondos aprox.) con el fin de mejorar la App, en un plan de marketing y ventas (60% de los fondos aprox.) con el fin de dar a conocer Nade y comenzar con la facturaci\u00f3n, y en gastos generales (20% de los fondos aprox.) como pueden ser el mantenimiento del servidor, las tarifas mensuales, los gastos en material, personal...\n\nEsta es nuestra p\u00e1gina web: www.nadeapp.com , en ella presentamos Nade, explicamos su funcionamiento, y desde ella se puede acceder a descargar la App en diferentes plataformas, o a acceder a la versi\u00f3n web de la App."

Those dogs were formerly loved, but some of their owners didn't know how to keep them from developing behavioral problems that made life difficult for both of them. Despite the fact that training is critical for having a happy pet-owning family, many owners do not have the time or resources to provide their dogs with the training they require.\nThat is why we created the dog training app to assist in the creation of a beloved companion rather than a statistic. You get clear instructions and specialized training help directly on your phone.\nWith video instruction and troubleshooting tips, this is a unique and accessible dog training program for owners. On your smartphone, you can use tried-and-true methods created by one of the leading training centers in USA\n\n\n\nTHE APP\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Access to Your Own Community & Join Groups That Meets You & your Dogs Needs\u00a0\nDirect Support from Jamaal & the Bark For Attention Team\n\u00a0Bark For Attention Community Support with Feed & Chat\u00a0\n\u00a0Access to Video Bark For Attention Video Courses\u00a0\nAccess to Bark For Attention Video Group Coaching\nAttend Exclusive Monthly Webinars & Office Hours\n\u00a0Access a Growing Video Library of Recorded Training Materials\u00a0\nAccess to blogs & forms with educational information about dog training\n\u00a0Free Doggy Journal Downloadable handouts and E Books\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nYour Community \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt necessitates extensive video production, photography, and local resources, as well as intricate back-end development.

        "Text": "\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Did you know that doctors recommend cleaning or changing the mask after each use?\nThis is true. According to Johns Hopkins University, you must cleanse or change the mask after each use. But who actually does it? You simply do not have time to quit washing every day, or change your mask several times during the day. By changing the mask, we increase the amount of waste, but we not always carry a spare mask with us and during the day we take off our mask more than once and put or hang up somewhere, thereby accumulating microbes and viruses in the object that protects us.\n\u00a0In the face of the current pandemic, we have drastically changed our hygiene practices. You will see that more and more people care about the cleanliness of the surrounding air and things. As a result, we tend to carry more cleaning devices with us than ever before, and until now we have not seen anyone make a product that can combine all of these functions and make it more convenient. Therefore, we would like to present our new invention - Subleme Plus.\nSubleme Plus is a highly portable solution to your contaminated mask woes:\n\u00a0- Pop it in \u00a0your pocket\n\u00a0- Keep it in your car\n\u00a0- \u00a0Put it with your masks at home\n\u00a0- In the foyer\n\u00a0- At the office\n\u00a0- \u00a0Anywhere where you might need a mask!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith concern about our health and the health of loved ones and relatives, we came up with a new device Subleme Plus. With the Subleme Plus we can safely disinfect our everyday items that we use so often.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow is it work:\nMicroorganisms multiply by replicating genetic material in the nucleus of living cells, and ultraviolet light can alter and rearrange the helical structure of DNA / RNA, stopping cell division. And because our LED is in the range where DNA / RNA is most sensitive, Subleme Plus can perform better in cleaning than other products. Today, all microorganisms, including viruses and bacteria that have become resistant to antibiotics, are vulnerable to UVC rays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the UVC LEDs in the device that radiate in the wavelength range of 200-280 nm, it ensures the sterilization of items such as masks, pens, keys, jewelry in a brief time like 10-20 seconds. The inside of our device has UV-C rays and it provides a sterile environment for storing the mask when we need to take it off. It is very easy to use, all you have to do is place your belongings, close the lid and press the button. After the process is completed, the light on it will turn off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubleme Plus offers various advantages over the traditionally used mercury lamps and UV lamps. It is the most effective, environmentally-friendly, and chemical-free way to keep your things clean.\n\n\n\n\n\nSubleme Plus is fully rechargeable. Thanks to new technologies, one charge will last from 15 to 30 days of operation. And the microprocessor itself, which generates UV-C rays, lasts for 90,000 hours of operation without stopping.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nSubleme Plus is completely portable and easy to carry, you can put it in your shoulder bag or in your pockets, always protecting it from harmful microorganisms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is not just a disinfection device, it is our health, a person close to us. The disinfection process is very simple and absolutely safe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubleme Plus is made from a high-strength aluminum alloy that does not harm human health or the surrounding nature.\nEvery year, more than 10 million tons of garbage get into our oceans and surrounding nature. We believe that waste reduction must come together to cope with the global pollution of our planet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubleme Plus will be made with high quality and durable materials to ensure a long lifetime and to be a reliable companion on all your adventures, indoors and outdoors.\nWe are ensuring recyclable by only using suitable materials for Subleme Plus and its packaging (solely cardboard and no plastic).\nThe materials mentioned above are not only recyclable, but are in combination with the long lifetime also a sustainable choice. Where possible (e.g. packaging) we are not only setting a focus on sustainable materials, but also on reducing the use of materials as much as possible.\nFactories that we will chose for mass production will be carefully evaluated regarding compliance with environmental regulations. Emphasis will also be put on social conditions as health and safety, working hours, minimum wages, labor practices and discrimination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Together, it has infinite possibilities. Sing, dance, play, laugh! Let the party begin!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe created an extremely rich expression system for Eilik in order to make him more lifelike, including laughing, yelling, crying, depressed, speechless, disappointed, cute, funny, wronged, cursing, angry, and so on. In addition, Eilik can express himself vividly thanks to dynamic animations and a 25 fps OLED screen.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nOur in-house animation team is hard at work behind Eilik's real-life expression to make Eilik more vivid and fun. Every action necessitates the coordination and cooperation of screenwriters, storytellers, animation producers, and voice actors, before being shown to Eilik by the software engineer.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegular updates are available via Eilik's cross-platform software, so that he will be smarter, get more expressions, and download more plot content. Every update will make Eilik a better bot for you.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to make Eilik's arm and body more flexible and dexterous, we have designed a new servo motor especially. EM3 is 100% self-developed, from the gear layout, circuit board, to the control algorithm. Compared with the traditional 9g servo, the torque of EM3 can reach up to 3kg.\n\n\n\n\n\nEM3 can efficiently protect gears and offset external force with its overload clutch protection function. Position, voltage, temperature, and current feedback are all supported by the EM3's comprehensive control protocol, which uses a universal serial communication interface. Basic current-loop control is also available. A specific control and debugging software is also included with the EM3.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe've cooperated with international carriers like FedEx, UPS, DHL, and USPS. Kindly note that the price above doesn't include shipping costs, taxes, or additional duties. COVID-19 is still delaying international shipping in many places, but things are better now, and we hope that by the time we start shipping, the delivery time can be back to normal. We will update you with the whole shipping process continuously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergize Lab is an innovative startup focusing on robotics technology and products, including robot joints, control systems, servo motor, BLDC motor, and consumer robot. With our own patented robot technology and experienced animation experts, our team is committed to creating a robot with soul and endless fun.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur team is formed by a group of experienced engineers, designers, animators, and developers. As robot passionists, we have been working hard to make Eilik come true in the past two years, and we are glad that we have finally made it here. We chose to launch Eilik first here as we believe that this awesome community can give us more inspiration and incredible ideas. We look forward to having you as our co-creator, and let's make Eilik a better bot for everyone.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Whatever it is you're growing, we want to help. After almost 2 years of prototyping, we've decided to launch a Kickstarter campaign to fund and pre-sell the mass-production of Oasis-Grow, our first line of environmental monitoring tools and automated container growing systems for hobbyists gardeners, underground cultivators, and small farmers. \u00a0\n\nWhy Oasis-Grow?\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nOasis-Grow, developed by Oasis-X, is our first fleet of products consisting of camera, remote sensing, and environmental control modules aimed to help smaller and medium-sized growers save time, measure what matters, and produce more with less. This lineup of growing automation products includes hardware and software modules for computer vision, environmental sensing, and AC equipment control as well as a few ready to grow container farming systems.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does it help my growing?\n\n\n\nMushrooms fruiting in a system controlled by oasis-grow modules\n\n\nOasis-Grow is a modular, easy-to-use set of tools for growing more with less. It is designed to enable controlled environment agriculture but can be applied to other areas as well. Deploy a simple camera to track harvest-readiness of fruit, add sensors to diagnose problems in your environment, plug in a controller to create the perfect conditions, or skip all of this with a ready-to-grow system. Our products collect images & data over time, actively regulating temperature, relative humidity, airflow, light, oxygen, and water cycles. Sensors, cameras, and programmatic alerts can monitor your growing system, allowing you to catch and prevent problems before they occur. \u00a0Users can set variable targets for feedback response and tune the system's built in PID controllers to create more desirable environments. With the ability to deploy plug-and-play containers or hook up 3rd party AC appliances in a chosen space, growers can more easily create the perfect environment for their application. Our system can be used offline and is secure with data encrypted at rest and in-transit.\u00a0\n\nBuilt for beginners & pros alike.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nPlug & Play: Oasis Family Container Farm\n\n\nGet started using a ready-to-grow container farming system, or outfit your existing grow with one of our environmental helper modules.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Growers, for Growers\u00a0\n\n\n\nTimelapse of MicroGreens in Sprouting Chamber with Oasis Camera\n\n\n\n\n\nFruiting a mushroom production block\n\n\nWe wouldn't sell a product we wouldn't use, which is why our prototypes are tested extensively on our demo farm installation. Our technology has been used to build real systems that grow real crops, which we encourage you to check out on our website and instagram!\n\n\n\nTreating explants for tissue culture\n\n\nOpen Source, Mod-Friendly, Powered by Raspberry Pi.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nOur open-source control software can take pictures, sense environmental factors, and command a variety of appliances to regulate your system. This means that you can modify core, extend with 3rd party electronics, and contribute new integrations + ideas! If you've ever used a Raspberry Pi or programmed a microcontroller, you'll be right at home accessing oasis-grow modules using the command line. Visit our GitHub to deploy your own configuration of our firmware. Build from scratch or add powerful new capabilities to an existing Pi setup.\n\nSimple Interface, Setup, & Remote Monitoring\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0On-device buttons & an LED status ring light interface can be used to start/stop the control cycle, connect to wifi, or run the drainage pump. This is in addition to the dashboard, where you can view images and data sent from a unit, adjust settings, update firmware, and run other tasks. \u00a0Adding a new device to your network is as easy as pressing a button, waiting a bit, connecting to the hotspot, and entering your credentials:\n\n\n\nData Collection & Analysis\u00a0\n\n\n\n24-Hour Oasis-Grow Sensor Data Plot\n\n\nOur cloud dashboard (for which we will release an open-source version soon) aggregates visual & sensor data to generate actionable media & analysis. Assemble time-lapses to share, save data for traceability, and learn from the past to improve future harvests. We plan to implement even more sensor options and integrate some of our community-contributed AI projects into the core remote image monitoring system.\n\n\n\nMachine Learning Prototype: Ripe Fruit Identification\n\n\nWho are we?\nOasis-X was founded by two engineers and long-time gardeners in response to food shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have backgrounds in computer science, hobby electronics, business management, product design, ecology, and biotechnology. Our team is passionate about making the future of farming accessible in every neighborhood!\n\n\n\nMike\n\n\n\n\n\nAvi\n\n\nAlmost Two Years In The Making\nWe have have been iterating on designs for this idea since the beginning of 2020. It has been incredibly rewarding to see our hardware go from concept drawings, to functioning proof of concept prototypes, to rugged hand-assembled beta units. Next steps will be to smooth out the edges and update our existing prototype designs to optimize manufacturability. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nPrototype Evolution: Vision, Sensor, & Control Module  \n\n\n\n\n\nPrototype Evolution: Oasis Family Container Farm\n\n\n\n\n\nPrototype Evolution: Vision & Sensor Module\n\n\nWhy are we doing this?\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rapidly increasing consolidation of farmland over the past century has resulted in a centralized food system that pushes out small farmers and is fragile, wasteful, and damaging to our environment. To feed a growing global population, we\u2019ll have to intensify these traditional farming and distribution methods which intensely pollute our atmosphere, soil, and water.\n\nWe believe that buying and selling local is the solution for many problems which plague our food system. We have the opportunity to embrace an alternative which allows us to eat healthier, use fewer resources, connect with our food, and cultivate confidence in where our products come from.\n\n \u00a0\u00a0In pursuit of this, our goal is to equip every cultivator with unprecedented control and visibility into their harvest. We aim to unlock the kind of productivity & resource-efficiency previously only achievable by those with capital to invest or deep technical expertise."

The average person drives between 10,000 and 15,000 miles and spends between $1,300 and $1,900 on gasoline per year. In comparison, the cost of electricity to power Myriad over the same distance is up to four times lower. Over the six year average length of car ownership, that's between $5,500 and $8,200 in gasoline savings.\nWe've assumed a fuel economy of 21 miles per gallon for a comparable gasoline powered premium sedan. We've also assumed the national average of $0.13 per kilowatt-hour for electricity, 10% charging on Tesla\u2019s Supercharger network and $2.85 per gallon for premium gasoline over the next six years.\n\nOur first car will be a SUV with solar pannel roof.\n\u00a0It will have a 2673 mm wheelbase, it will be 4500 mm long, 1650 mm wide , 1750 tall.\nIt will be available in 2 configurations , one single motor with rear wheel drive and one dual motor with AWD.\nThe single motor version will be equipped with 85 kWh battery pack and the dual motor with 100 kWh battery pack.\nThe power produced will be arround 400 hp for the single motor and 520 hp for the dual motor.\nNow we are at the stage of merging the software and hardware together.\nWe dont have a working prototype so we cant show it to you.\nWe have renders of how we wish the car to look but we cant share them because of kickstarter`s policy. Maybe we will be able to add them in an update.\n\nThank you!"

I am utterly flabbergasted that daters have been left with tinder as our main option for such a long time.\n\n\u2022The swipe novelty was great at its launch but over the years it has taken a toll, with poor innovation and then a monopoly forming in the market, explained later.\n\u2022It is time for change.\n\n\u2022The dating market is for the big boys. Big investment reaps huge rewards. It is impossible to launch something half-heartedly.\n\n\u2022To win in this market you have to compete with the Americans using their rules\u2026big pre-seed and seed funding, big valuations, big sales.\n\n\u2022I bring this presentation to you to seek investment to bring significant income, employment opportunities and funds to make charitable contributions for our communities.\n\nA slide deck for this appeal is presented here;\n\u00a0Slide Deck\u00a0"

        "Text": "OneClock is not an alarm clock\nLet\u2019s save the alarms for fires, burglaries and submarines. We researched the best tones, tempos and frequencies to wake you up. Then we asked Jon Natchez from The War on Drugs to create a collection of musical compositions to lift you out of sleep in a peaceful, more natural way.\u00a0\nOneClock is as much a piece of art as it is a functional household object.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Japan, Canada, EU, UK, Australia, Norway, Switzerland - \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured In:\n\n\n\n\n\nSleep is great, but waking up is better\nWe believe the only thing better than sleep is waking up. Because that\u2019s where all the love starts. We believe in waking up better, so you can live better and breathe better and think better.\n\n\n\n\n\nTake back the bedroom\nMake your bedroom your sanctuary, without all the gadgets and devices that seem to sneak stress and distractions in between the sheets with you. OneClock is designed to disconnect, so all you have is you, your thoughts, and perhaps a significant other in bed with you - human, canine, or feline. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nSonic science to start your day\nThere\u2019s a growing body of sonic research outlining the importance of waking up correctly and its effect on our mood and behavior. OneClock\u2019s sounds are designed to wake you gently and reliably.\n\n\n\n\n\nMusic composed by Grammy-winning artists\nYou deserve better, so we created a new way to wake up with Jon Natchez, renowned composer and multi-instrumentalist of The War on Drugs. OneClock\u2019s compositions are original recordings, not available elsewhere, and feature 20+ instruments that create a warm, organic and non-digital soundtrack to start your day.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nJon won a 2018 Grammy as a member of The War on Drugs, was formerly a member of the acclaimed group Beirut, and has performed and recorded with David Byrne, St. Vincent, Taylor Mac, Father John Misty, and Liza Minnelli, among many others. He has composed scores for numerous films and has contributed to over 100 albums, composing and arranging as well as playing more than 30 instruments.\n\n\n\nListen to the music samples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI music generator\nHumans can suffer from alarm fatigue and become desensitized to sounds they hear over and over. When OneClock\u2019s alarm is activated, our AI music generator will randomly choose one of the songs stored on the clock\u2019s solid state memory and remix it by adjusting the levels of each instrument or vocal for infinite combinations. It\u2019s subtle, but noticeable and you will never hear OneClock\u2019s songs the same way twice. Ever.\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeless analog design + slow-tech philosophy\nWarm, organic, minimalism meets an analog and tactile experience that\u2019s built to last a lifetime with high quality, sustainably sourced components.\u00a0In our current culture of Amazon/Walmart convenience, the approach we took was unorthodox. We prioritized design and quality over price to create a product that is enjoyable to experience amongst other cherished heirloom objects in your home.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nExtruded, precision machined, solid aluminum enclosure. Available in black, red, and white powder coat (raw aluminum coming soon). Solid rift sawn white oak, natural hand-oiled finish.\n\n\nMulti-function waking knob\u00a0\n\n\n\nSeamlessly toggle between the current time and waking time. Set, activate and turn off the alarm. Located on the front of the clock (where you need it).\nSwiss designed clock movement\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nStepper motor technology used in automotive gauges, offers precise and silent operation.\n\n\nSpeaker\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nWaking music plays through a high dynamic range BMR from Tectonic Labs  (4 \u03a9 / 10 Watts / 100Hz \u2013 20kHz full range).\n\n\nClock face\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe glass face is scratch resistant, low glare, and easy to read. \n\n\nScreen-free\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nWe left out the touchscreens and buttons in favor of knurled, solid aluminum knobs that provide a tactile, analog feel and precise control reminiscent of high-end audio components.\n\n\nNight light\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nTouch sensitive enclosure activates a low-light, warm glow, that turns off after five seconds.\u00a0\n\nAlarm indicator\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nLow-light integrated LED assures you that your OneClock is set to wake you up. It's just bright enough to see at night, but not any more than you need.\u00a0\n\nReliable power\u00a0\n\n\n\nPower is supplied by a fixed USB cable with a two-prong standard wall outlet AC adaptor. In the event of a power outage, OneClock has an internal backup system that stores your time and alarm settings for up to two weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat people are saying \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifications & Production\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ability to oversee design and production in our backyard allows us to deliver a high quality product while also supporting local craftsmen, partners and communities across the US. We\u2019ve been fortunate to collaborate with LINK PD and HWI to ensure that our engineering and production game is on point. With over 50+ years of experience across countless products, they allow us to move forward thoughtfully and confidently to bring our vision to life.\n\n\n\n\n\nWarranty\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nLifetime warranties typically come with a lot of fine print that often amounts to nothing more than a marketing ploy. We\u2019re matching our high end materials and hand built quality with a robust and straightforward policy. Our 20 year warranty ensures OneClock will be free from defects in materials and workmanship and operate as advertised.\n\nOur team\nWe\u2019re veteran musicians, strategists, creatives and artists that understand the value of waking up beautifully. Between us we have won Lions, Grammys, Emmys, Effies, Pencils, Coup de Couers, and other hard-to-win awards with weird names. And we have woken up each day for the past 25+ years to shape culture through products, campaigns, environmental initiatives, soundtracks, live performances, and the creation of vibrant, sustainable businesses.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\nCrowdfunding gives us the freedom to run our business exactly how we want. The revenue we generate here makes it possible for us to continue developing products without seeking outside funding. This allows us to focus on doing what we love: designing and bringing our visions to life, supported by an incredible community of like minded individuals that appreciate our philosophy.\nWe also deeply value the ability to have the Kickstarter community influence our products (who\u2019s our next musician?!?) through feedback and direct participation in our design process.\n\nShipping\u00a0and sales tax\nWe will ship complete units from our fulfillment facility in Denver, CO to anywhere in the US. All units will be shipped in a custom container engineered from high density cardboard and recycled protective foam. \u00a0Packages will be sent via UPS Ground, tracking included, for 1-5 day delivery at a cost of $14/clock.\u00a0\nIf state sales tax is applicable on your purchase, we'll follow up with you post-campaign with the cost and a method of payment.\n\nInternational orders\nOneClock will be available for delivery to select countries around the world. As shipping, handling, local charges and custom fees vary from country to country, please select your reward to see specific details about your location.\nCustomer is responsible for all applicable taxes or duties that may occur in your location. OneClock is shipped delivery duties unpaid (DDU).\nYou can find a complete list of the shipping costs per pledge as well as full shipping and handling details in our FAQs section. If you\u2019d like to back the project but your country isn\u2019t listed in the dropdown menu upon checkout, or if you have any further questions about shipping, please feel free to contact us.\u00a0\n\nSupport\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther reading\u00a0\nHere are a few of our guiding lights that helped inform the design of OneClock:\nWhy Sleep Matters\nWhy Snoozers Are Losers\nBlue light has a dark side\n71% of Americans who own smartphones sleep with them\nOne in three kids under 18 wake up to check their mobile device at least once a night\nMore on alarm fatigue\nDevices create a mental state of \u201cthreat vigilance\u201d in the bedroom\nWaking sounds and sleep inertia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarter launches with 1,400+ successful Kickstarter projects and over $500M raised in total.\nhttp://jellop.com/?utm_source=Oneclock"

All you need is a Web Browser (Chrome, Edge or Opera) and you can upload apps or write code to run on your watch wirelessly! Bangle.js is waterproof and AI enabled and comes with bluetooth low energy, GPS, a heart rate monitor, accelerometer and more.\nWant to know more?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Nearform gave out pre-release Bangle.js watches to everyone at the NodeConf EU conference. They have a write-up, and you can also \u00a0see what they're saying on Twitter!\u00a0\nYou can also check out the documentation put together by the Nearform for the conference, which covers getting started with the watches - bear in mind that these are still pre-release watches!\nHackster has an interview and article about Bangle.js\u00a0\nGordon was a guest on the SAP Labs Talk Podcast\u00a0\nHeise.de has an article (in German) about Bangle.js too\u00a0\nThere are also articles in Computer Weekly, FOSSBytes, CNX Software, IT Knowledge Exchange, and many others\u00a0\n\n\nHardware Specs\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIP68 Waterproof: up to 10m underwater\nNordic 64MHz nRF52832 ARM Cortex-M4 processor with Bluetooth LE\n64kB RAM 512kB on-chip flash, 4MB external flash\n1.3 inch 240x240 16 bit LCD display with 2 zone touch\nGPS/Glonass receiver (UBlox)\nHeart rate monitor\n3 Axis Accelerometer (with Pedometer and Tap detect)\n3 Axis Magnetometer\nPiezo speaker and Vibration motor\n350mAh battery, 1 week standby time\n5 x 5 x 1.7 cm case, plastic with stainless steel ring\nCan be disassembled with just 4 screws\n\u00a0\n\nSoftware Specs\n\nEasy to code and debug wirelessly using JavaScript or our graphical editor (based on Blockly)\nPre-programmed with the Espruino Open Source JavaScript interpreter\u00a0\nVast majority of JavaScript ES5 features and many ES6 features including: Regular Expressions, Promises, Arrow Functions, Template Literals\n40kB RAM for program memory/variables\nBluetooth 4.2 Advertising, Central and Peripheral mode support with built-in Nordic UART service\nGraphics library with Vector fonts, bimap rotate & scale\nTensorflow Lite for Microcontrollers AI\nWear-levelled flash filesystem\nHeatshrink compression\nUpload functions written in C or ARM Assembler\nBuilt-in wireless debugging\nVT100 Terminal support on LCD\nProgram with Web-based Web Bluetooth IDE or Node.js-based command line tools\n\u00a0\n\nApps\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause Bangle.js is entirely open, you can upload the apps we\u2019ve already developed, create your own, or upload apps created by the online community.\nOur app store (at banglejs.com/apps) will be entirely free. We\u2019ll never share your data with third parties or make your use of our apps dependent on third party cloud services. So far we\u2019ve created some great apps including games, a compass, map, spirit level, QR code display and heart rate monitor (to name a few) and we have lots more to come.\nWe already have a great online community (our forum has over 35,000 posts!) and we\u2019re excited to see what apps you come up with!\nDroidScript support\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe'll also be working with David from DroidScript to make sure that there's a nice, easy way for you to write Android phone apps in JavaScript that will talk to Bangle.js. While Bangle.js can work completely independently (and we'll have Gadgetbridge for notifications from your phone), DroidScript provides a fast, easy way to use your phone's internet connection to push data to Bangle.js in the background using the same JavaScript language.\nWho are we?\nI\u2019m Gordon Williams, the creator of Bangle.js. I\u2019m a software engineer who loves tinkering with hardware. 7 years ago I became frustrated with the steep learning curve required to create software for microcontrollers and started working on Espruino. I\u2019ve been working full-time on it since the end of the first Espruino KickStarter campaign in 2013. My work is Open Source and funded by sales of my Espruino devices and the support of the online community via Patreon.\nSince Espruino\u2019s first KickStarter campaign, I (with a bit of help from family and friends) have:\n\nShipped over 30,000 official Espruino devices\nDeveloped 5 further Espruino devices (including the wifi board, Pico, Puck.js, Pixl.js and the MDBT42Q breakout board)\nLaunched and successfully delivered two more KickStarter campaigns\nWritten over 11,000 forum posts\nProduced over 100 online tutorials and over 90 YouTube videos for Espruino\nFixed over 1500 GitHub issues for the Espruino project\nMade over 3700 GitHub commits in Espruino, and many more in other Espruino-related projects like the IDE.\n\u00a0\n\nSeveral others have provided a huge amount of help with Bangle.js: Nearform Research has done a lot of work on the AI, apps, documentation, testing and publicity for their Nodeconf EU conference, and Fanoush's work on nRF52-based smart bands was instrumental when figuring out how to replace Bangle.js's factory firmware.\nWhy Bangle.js?\nIt feels great to use things you\u2019ve made, but even if you are an experienced hardware designer it\u2019s difficult to make yourself a watch that is reliable and useful long term, let alone waterproof and affordable.There\u2019s some amazing hardware already out there, but it\u2019s usually crippled by bad software and isn't supported of upgraded.\nThat\u2019s why we decided to take a powerful, well-designed Smartwatch that already exists, completely reverse engineer it and replace all of its firmware with our Open Source software to really unlock its capabilities.\nWhy JavaScript?\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloping software for embedded devices can be a real pain. You normally need wires attached to the device you\u2019re developing for, and you need to install and set up a complex toolchain. Anything more than a few lines of code can take a minute or more to compile and upload to the chip, and this applies to every change you make. Many tools don\u2019t even allow for debugging.\nBangle.js has none of those problems. The Espruino JavaScript interpreter allows you to upload code and debug wirelessly out of the box using just a Web Browser, with no need to install software on your computer.\nTensorflow Lite AI\n\n\n\n\n\nTensorflow Lite for Microcontrollers is built into \u00a0Bangle.js\u2019s firmware so you can run machine learning models wirelessly on your wrist! This allows you to detect gestures using the accelerometer. If you\u2019re feeling adventurous you can customise the data you collect and create or update machine learning models without even having to reboot your watch!\nSimply train and test your model on your PC with Tensorflow, then create a tflite model and upload it to your watch.\nOpen Source\nBangle.js uses the Open Source (MPLv2) Espruino JavaScript interpreter. All source code, tools and documentation are provided under an Open Source licence.\nWe\u2019re using an existing watch so we can\u2019t provide original schematics (we don\u2019t have any!), however the information we have gained from reverse engineering the watches will be made Open Source.\nWhat do you get?\nIf your reward contains a Bangle.js, you\u2019ll get a box containing:\n\nA Bangle.js Smartwatch\nA Magnetic USB charge cord\nGetting Started instructions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepending on which reward you chose, you may get other Espruino Bluetooth boards as well. These all run JavaScript, can communicate with Bangle.js, and are programmed with the Espruino Web IDE. From left to right:\n\n\u00a0Espruino Puck.js - a small, self-contained Bluetooth button with 3 axis magnetometer\n\u00a0Espruino MDBT42Q breakout board - a tiny, low power Bluetooth board that can run off a wide range of voltages and fit on a breadboard\n\u00a0Espruino Pixl.js - a low power Bluetooth LCD with Arduino pinout\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Rewards?\nWant something that there isn't a reward for? You can select one reward and then pledge extra - for instance if you wanted two Bangle.js and a MDBT42 board (above), you could select the 'Hackers Edition' and pledge \u00a3117 (\u00a360 + \u00a310 + \u00a347), the cost of the Hackers edition with postage, plus a single Bangle.js.\nCurrent Status\nWe\u2019ve just purchased and programmed 400 watches for the attendees of the Nodeconf EU Conference running from 10th-13th November 2019, so we\u2019re confident in our ability to source and program the hardware. While the firmware is very capable right now (as shown in the video), there is still a lot that we\u2019re planning \u00a0to do:\n\nMore applications\nDocumentation, examples and tutorials\nAdding features to the firmware (pedometer, etc)\nPower usage profiling and improvements\nTesting and bug fixing\n\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019re confident that we can get this done \u00a0and ship your rewards in time, as we have with our previous KickStarter campaigns. As with our other Espruino devices, Bangle.js will continue to receive software updates long after this campaign ends.\nProduction Timeline\nBecause we\u2019re using existing hardware, our timeline is a lot easier than it has been for previous products, but we\u2019re trying to set realistic deadlines with some wiggle room in case there\u2019s a delay in production at the factory.\n\n\u00a0Now: further development of Bangle.js firmware, documentation and apps\n\u00a0End of November: KickStarter finishes\n\u00a0Mid December: funds clear, watches ordered, beta test watches programmed and shipped\n\u00a0Early February: watches arrive\n\u00a0February/March: watch programming, packing and shipping\n\u00a0\n\nTHE PIXELMASTER\nThe Pixelmaster is a graphical representation of all the amazing support we receive during this KickStarter campaign. Every Bangle.js will have an \u2018About\u2019 screen built into the firmware, and everyone who buys a Bangle.js will get to choose the colour of 9 pixels on the screen from the 16 colour Mac palette:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Backers who pledge additional support will get an extra pixel per \u00a31 pledged. But which pixels? You get to choose! Those with most pixels chose first, and if you have the same number of pixels as someone else, you get first dibs if you pledged first.\nStretch Goals\n\u00a340,000 (ACHIEVED): You can write simple code graphically right now, but if we reach this stretch goal we\u2019ll be extending our graphical editor with support for Graphics, Menus and Images. This will make it even easier to create good-looking apps without any coding knowledge.\n\u00a375,000 (ACHIEVED) : We\u2019ll add an online file system to the Espruino Web IDE so you don\u2019t need to save your apps or code you\u2019re working on to your computer. This means you\u2019ll be able to develop, access and save your apps easily from anywhere at any time.\n\u00a3100,000 (ACHIEVED) : Optimised graphics mode for games. Bangle.js already has an unbuffered 240x240x16 bit graphics mode, as well as a double-buffered 240x160x16 bit mode. With this stretch goal we'll be adding low-resolution 8 bit buffered graphics which will make it much easier to write full-colour, fast moving games (and other graphics).\nSmall Print\nWe pride ourselves on being open - not just with Open Source software, but about everything. Bangle.js is a pretty awesome piece of hardware, and is great value at this price, but there are a few things that aren\u2019t perfect. So that you\u2019re not disappointed, we think you ought to know that:\n\nWe\u2019re shipping from the UK - if you are not in Europe you may be liable to import taxes.\nThe touchscreen is two zone (not full touch)\nThe piezo speaker is pretty quiet\nThe heart rate monitor doesn\u2019t always read accurately when you\u2019re moving around\nWe\u2019ll be adding support for notifications from GadgetBridge on Android, but don\u2019t have any plans to support iOS.\nWeb Bluetooth works on Windows 10, Mac OS, Chromebook, Android and Linux. iOS requires a cheap paid app (WebBLE). While we have a native application for programming Bangle.js in Windows 8 and earlier, there is currently no Web Bluetooth support.\n\u00a0\n"

This is an extra safety feature that is built into the helmet to add protection against rotational motion transferred to the brain. Rotational motion affects the brain and increase the risk for minor and severe brain injuries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChips On Board (COB) is a method of LED packaging which has a number of advantages over more conventional technologies. It allows for a more compact footprint whilst delivering a higher intensity of light meaning you\u2019ll be seen from further away. It is also what gives the lights a more uniform look. We like to think of it as Currently Our Best LED technology.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s our most vented helmet yet. We\u2019ve been listening to customer feedback and have paid very close attention to the way Ultra directs air through its internal venting system. We\u2019ve created 3 enormous exhausts in the rear to ensure hot air gets pushed out helping to keep the rider cool whether on a commute or on a training session.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve already done the initial crash tests on our beta units and they pass with plenty of safety margin to spare. We\u2019re confident that Ultra will be one of the safest helmets on road even without the lights on.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you ride, you must be prepared to ride in any weather. That's why Ultra is built to IPX6 standards, to withstand the elements and keep you riding bright, come rain or shine.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe've worked really hard to improve the weight of our smart helmets. By using more efficient manufacturing methods, we were able to use less material without compromising the high level of protection that our helmets provide. Our very first helmet weighed in at 490 grams, Ultra is estimated to have a final weight of 370 grams. Now that's a big win (or loss).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are multiple benefits to wearing lights high up on the head. Firstly, it makes it possible to be seen more clearly by motorists on the road. You're less likely to encounter a situation where your lights are being blocked by parked cars or other things on the road. Secondly, by illuminating your head, it's much easier for motorists to see where you're looking and thus know approach more carefully.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Kickstarter, we've decided to go crazy with colors. The beauty of pre-launching Ultra is that we get to lock down the exact quantities of colors and sizes so that we can optimise production, and therefore create more variants and ensure you find the perfect one.\nThe colors you see here are likely going to be limited to just Kickstarter. After the campaign ends, many of the colors here will NOT make it to retail.\u00a0So if you see a color you like, now may be the only time to get it.\nWe will be gathering feedback throughout the campaign on what colors our backers would like to see. We have a few ideas already, such as metallic colors, country colors and possibly even 2-tone colors that change with different viewing angles. Stay tuned\u00a0:D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUltra is the helmet for everyone, from kids to even bigger kids. It is available in the sizes S, M-L and XL, and they are all equipped with a click-dial fit system to ensure that Ultra sits firmly yet comfortably on your head.\n\nSmall (S): 51- 55 cm\nMedium to Large (M-L): 54- 61 cm\nExtra Large (XL): 61- 65 cm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite starting with a design brief of creating the successor to the wildly popular Kickstart helmet, but at half the cost, the design of Ultra has been a labour of love. We could\u2019ve just taken the simpler approach of cutting costs from the Kickstart helmet, but we wanted to create a helmet that takes all of our learnings from building smart wearables and push the limits of helmet design to completely new heights. We\u2019ve agonized over all the small details refining them to the point where they\u2019d feel more at home on a $200+ helmet.\nJust a few of the things we\u2019ve considered include a design that\u2019s not too overstated, yet exudes style. We\u2019ve taken an even more focused user-centric approach to consider useful extras such as the sun visor and overall weight, as well as taking a keen interest in venting to help keep the head cool on more demanding rides. We\u2019re super stoked about how the design has progressed over Ultra\u2019s development cycle, and know that our customers will appreciate the attention to detail once they get the product in their hands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom sketches, to CAD, to 3D printed models and design validation beta prototypes, we are now in the final stages of the design process. We are collecting tons of valuable feedback and are working on refinements to release the perfect product. With each new version, we get closer to the ultimate helmet for cycling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplay with sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay with  sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe've completed our beta testing phase.

Lumos Ultra really deserves the name, and frankly should be selling like hot cakes. The Lumos Ultra shows how the brand has matured from its Kickstarter roots into an established and innovative company. \u2014 James Gill, Nuneaton UK\nHonestly having lights on your helmet is life changing.. The thing I like best is that if I have any doubt about whether a driver has seen me, I can look at them or their rear view mirror and know the light will flash right at them. \u2014 Caterina Buizza, London, UK\nNot only will you will be investing in your safety, but you will also be getting a premium helmet. Ultra is light and breathable. It\u2019s innovative, giving you THAT thing that other helmets are missing. I love how it looks awesome and really feels great. \u2014 Francisco Garcia, New York\nFor anyone that was on the fence with the previous products due to price, hopefully this new version makes the decision much easier. Just as effective as the previous versions in terms of safety (see and be seen), but with a sleek new design and more accessible price point? What\u2019s not to like\u2026.! \u2014 John Yu, San Francisco\nThis is by far the best helmet if you want great protective gear, slick looks -and- lights. With the lights on your head they are above car roofs so they can always be seen. The cool look, the ventilation and the lightweight, non-bothering fit makes this my A+ choice for my 100 k per day commute as well as for ride my race bike or going on trails with my kids. \u2014 Henrik Becker, Germany\nI love the concept of the Lumos helmet. I\u2019m pretty sure my previous Lumos helmet saved my life before. The Ultra feels like a totally normal helmet. The price is reasonable for any helmet and it looks like a helmet I would buy even if it didn\u2019t have lights. Throw in the lights and it\u2019s totally a no-brainer! Everyone should have one! \u2014 David Rolfe, San Francisco\nIt\u2019s obvious that Lumos Ultra was built on love and experience.\nI have been following Lumos products since the first helmet came out on Kickstarter, and I believe the Ultra is the best one yet. It looks really cool, is super comfortable to wear, and feels very light on my head. As a surgeon, I have to go to the hospital at odd hours, lots of midnights and early mornings.. Since I\u2019ve had the Ultra helmet, I am more confident in cycling to work. The bright lights and turn signals makes me feel more visible on the road, and visible is safe! In broad daylight, the smooth design and good-looking colors turns a lot of heads! \u2014 Petra Wahjoepramono, Indonesia\nAre you are looking for a helmet that gives you the best protection both day and night? Look no further! Lumos Ultra is lightweight, high quality, durable and has the most awesome front and tail lights customization that other similar helmets only can only dream of. \u2014 Stijn Buyse, Belgium\nThis is the Tesla of bike helmets. Style functionality, safety features and comfort. It\u2019s unlike any helmet I have seen on the road. This is the future of bike helmets. \u2014 Grant Leslie, Australia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\u00a0\nThis timeline is for the first batch of Lumos Ultra with and without MIPS, size M-L. \u00a0\nWe estimate that sizes S and XL will be shipped out starting from Jan 2021. This is because the factory has a limited production capacity per month in order to control a high level of quality. Therefore we will be focusing on getting the more popular M-L sizes out first.\u00a0\nAs this is an estimate, timelines may get pushed up or pushed back but we will give our 100% to make sure that things are completed on, or even ahead of schedule.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of the campaign, we will send you a Backerkit survey via email.\nFrom there, you will be able to choose your: Color, MIPS-add on, size, visor and other add-ons we might release throughout the campaign.\nColor\nThe beauty of choosing your colors at the end of the campaign, is that you will be able to choose from all the new colors that we release at each stage of the campaign.\nNote: Many of the colors we are making for the Kickstarter will NOT be available for retail. If you see a color combination you really like, now might be the ONLY time to get it.\u00a0\nMIPS\nIf you have already purchased the Lumos Ultra MIPS reward, you will not need to add MIPS in the survey. It will be assigned to you automatically.\nHowever, if you have bought the standard Lumos Ultra, you will still be able to purchase the MIPS add-on for the difference in price between the rewards.\nSize\nWe will be launching Ultra in small (S), medium to large (M-L) and extra large sizes (XL) so that anyone from kids to adults can have an Ultra. You will be able to choose the size you want through the Backerkit survey we send you at the end of the campaign.\nVisor\nYou will also be able to add on the attachable visor if you decide that you need one for your daily ride. The visor will retail for $25, but for this campaign, we are launching it at only $14.95.\nOther add-ons\nWe are currently working on some Lumos merchandise, ranging from other cycling gear to everyday wear items. Once we lock down the designs and start building prototypes, we will share them with you! You will also be able to buy these add-ons through the Backerkit survey.\n\n\n\n\n\nShipping, Taxes (and VAT) will be calculated and paid for towards the end of the campaign, before we ship the helmets out to you. During these uncertain times, shipping costs have gone up significantly, however, we do believe that the prices will go down as the situation gets better globally.\nHence, we do not think charging shipping right now, upon pledging is at the interest of our supporters as the prices today might be more expensive than that in a few months time.\nHere are our estimates of what shipping would be.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n* Prices do not include taxes and VAT. That will be subject to the laws and regulations of each individual country.\n\u00a0** Note that these prices are dependent on the situation and may increase or decrease by a few dollars in the months to come.\n\"I don't see my country as a shipping option\" : If you do not see your country as a shipping option, it means that we currently do not offer shipping to that country. However, do send us an email if you are from a country that is not shown above, we'd love to know about it. If enough of you request for it such that it makes sense logistically to ship to that country, we will add it as an option later.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them."

        "Text": "\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s finally here. The versatile welding machine designed for DIY projects. Giving you the power to build anything, right from home.\nThe MP200 is a powerful 5-in-1 machine that combines the four most popular types of welding and plasma cutting into one lightweight package. Made for your home or workshop, it opens up a world of possibilities - at a price point that would have been impossible before.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are YesWelder. And we\u2019re on a mission to make welding accessible to everyone by bringing industrial-grade technologies into a consumer-grade machine. For the past 15 years, we\u2019ve been focused on manufacturing high-quality welding machines and equipment for professional welders and enthusiasts around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe DIY hobbyists of the world have exciting projects in mind, and they want to build them right where they live - home. Whether it\u2019s a new stool for the kitchen, or a firepit for the backyard that everyone can gather around on a Saturday night. And what better time to start than now?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong with today\u2019s welders?\nThe problem is that most welders today are very limiting. They can only handle one or two types of welding. And they almost never include plasma cutting. That means you\u2019ll need several expensive machines just for one project. It\u2019s a waste of money, patience, or shelf space.\nThis makes welding seem out of reach for beginners, causing them to delay their dream projects or forget about them entirely. We\u2019re here to change all that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe MP200 is the most versatile 5-in-1 welding machine specially designed for home DIY or maintenance projects. It\u2019s a true multi-process welder, so whether you're welding MIG, Flux-Cored, TIG, or MMA, or cutting through a new piece of metal, it will perform like a Pro.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe answer is simple. You can use just one tool to get endless jobs done! That\u2019s the beauty of 5-in-1.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Disclaimer: The pictures above represent welding project ideas that can be fabricated using the MP200. They are not made using the MP200. The list is not exhaustive, and we look forward to seeing more creations.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the easiest style of welding to learn, MIG welding is especially popular with home welders for its excellent control on thin metals. Built especially for home use, the MP200 uses a synergic control mechanism when performing MIG welds. That means when you set the current, the MP200 will automatically match the voltage and wire feeding speed for you, making it really simple to use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoved for its versatility, MMA welding can be done even under windy outdoor conditions. The MP200 even allows you to use those tricky 6010 rods to build yourself a sturdy shop stool or mend fences around the property \u2014 no matter the weather, and no gas tank required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for an unbreakable bond, the security of flux-cored welding is hard to beat. It\u2019s great for handling thicker metals, so it will have no problem mending your machinery or helping get that motorcycle on the road after you finish repairs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIG welders hide hours of work behind beautiful welds that look clean and precise. We went above and beyond to equip the MP200 with a lift start for TIG that\u2019s been optimized to reduce spatter, offering you a smoother weld and greater control in a more user friendly design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed to resize a piece of metal for your motorcycle frame? Cut through anything all on the same machine. The MP200's plasma cutter will cleanly slice through steel and can sever up to 1/2'' (12.7mm) steel. Giving you perfectly flat edges to work with \u2014 without ever switching tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe MP200\u2019s 4.3\u2019\u2019 high-pixel display puts everything you need on one big, bright, colorful screen. Making it easy on the eyes, and easy-to-use even for beginners.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd switching between welding styles and plasma cutting is simple. Just turn the dial to select the full color icon you need. The images are intuitive and easy to recognize, so it\u2019s always clear which style you\u2019ve selected. And you can easily choose your gas type and clearly monitor gas levels.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe MP200 is the most user-friendly welder we\u2019ve made yet - smart enough to know which settings you need for the job. Just input your material thickness and gas type, and the MP200 will adjust the current and voltage settings for you. Making it the perfect guide if you\u2019re new to welding or starting a project you\u2019re unsure of.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd if you\u2019re a seasoned welder, you can ditch the cruise control by overriding default current and voltage settings and revert to manual for greater control over your welds. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe MP200 makes your work even simpler with its smart Memory function. Once you find the voltage and current settings that match your style, the MP200 will remember them, storing up to 10 memory options for each type of welding. Keep your favorite settings on tap for next time you put the gloves on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA safer, smarter chip. The MP200\u2019s processor is focused on your safety, as well as your performance. If it senses the machine is getting too hot or there\u2019s too much current, the M200 will automatically cut off the power supply, protecting your work and keeping you safe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor powerful, creative projects. The MP200 is equipped with our most efficient high-frequency transformer. Tailor made to give you a fast and stable current for smoother, cleaner welds. It runs at 110V or 220V, so it\u2019s ready for work on any continent from North America to Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd we\u2019ve upgraded the MP200 to include not one, but two high-speed fans that use a seven-leaf design to silently keep your machine cool. Even when it\u2019s running hard.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a comfortable 25lbs, the MP200 is designed to put enough power in your hands to tackle any project from home. And light enough to move with you from project to project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut don\u2019t let its weight fool you. The MP200\u2019s steel unibody construction is tough enough to handle life in any workshop and can even withstand an accidental drop. We built it strong, so you can count on it to be there for your projects for years to come.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe want you to be ready for work on Day 1. So we\u2019re giving you everything you need to start welding right away, all in one box. From welding and cutting torches to the oil-water separator, and more.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake your work to the next level with these additional add-ons. Save big by purchasing together with your MP200 5-in-1 welding machine.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur trusted line of quality welding helmets.

We will fix all the minor issues of the sample machine before mass production.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the unedited demo video that demonstrates the full range of our product's functionality without any post-production edit.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe YesWelder journey started in 2006 with a mission to provide high quality welding equipment to those who love and practice the craft. Drawing on their decade\u2019s worth of industry experience, our 5 founders started manufacturing high-performance tools and used third-party platforms to establish a presence within the welding community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we continued to build our foundation, we realized how important it was to not just manufacture quality equipment but also to understand those who need, use and buy our products. That\u2019s why, in 2018, we transformed YesWelder into a Direct to Consumer brand. This change allowed us to develop meaningful and long-lasting connections with our end users. With their feedback, we have been able to craft even better products that speak to their real-life needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are now in the prototype stage, and we will soon enter the mass production stage after the campaign goes live. \u00a0Also, we plan to start shipping in late September. \u00a0All the backers\u2019 shipping information will only be collected through the Kickstarter survey after the end of the project. We will keep you updated about the shipping status in the project update section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe MP200 is built to last. Both the machines and accessories are made of reliable parts. We strictly control each manufacturing process to ensure that it not only looks premium, but also consistently delivers high performance to be a long-term addition to your garage or workshop.\nWhat\u2019s more, we offer a 1-year warranty since the day you received the machine and stand free replacement of the machine if there is any natural quality problem within that period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are proud to connect over 300,000 YesWelder fans all over the world. And we will ship YesWelder FIRSTESS\u2122 MP200 as soon as possible after the campaign ends. It\u2019ll be another amazing journey to shape the future of home project tools with you all.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSharing the stories of welders from all walks of life. From beginners to veterans, hobbyists to professionals, welding is the craft that brings us together. Subscribe to our Instagram, and you can also communicate with other owners and interact with professional welders or DIY enthusiasts that have like-minded interests.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs firm believers that passionate and skilled tradespeople are the backbone of the welding industry, we\u2019ve not only lowered the barriers for welders to access quality equipment but are also committed to building a strong community that brings together tens of thousands of welding professionals and hobbyists from all walks of life and all skill levels to share their stories and experiences across our various digital channels, including our #WhyWeWeld blog.
